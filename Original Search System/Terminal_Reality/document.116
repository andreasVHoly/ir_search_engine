Made In Space, Inc.


Made In Space, Inc. is an American-based company, specializing in the engineering and manufacturing of three-dimensional printers for use in microgravity. Headquartered in Mountain View, California on Moffett Field, Made In Space's 3D printer (Zero-G Printer) was the first manufacturing device in space.


== History ==
Made In Space was founded in August 2010, by Aaron Kemmer, Jason Dunn, Mike Chen, and Michael Snyder, during that year's Singularity University Graduate Studies Program. Their primary mission is to enable humanity to become a multi-planetary species. In the spring of 2011, Made In Space created their 3D Printing Lab, at the NASA Ames Research Center, on Moffett Field, Mountain View, California. That summer, they were awarded sub-orbital flight, through NASA's Flight Opportunities Program. From July through September 2011, the Made In Space team performed over 400 microgravity test parabolas, on NASA's reduced gravity aircraft (the "Vomit Comet"), proving their 3D printing in microgravity. With this proven concept, Made In Space was award a Phase 1 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant, with NASA, for the design of a 3D printer to be tested on the International Space Station (ISS).
In January 2013, Made In Space was awarded Phase 2 of the SBIR, by NASA, to build and flight qualify an additive manufacturing facility, with their 3D printer, for the International Space Station (ISS). Phase 3 was award in February 2013, as a sole source contract to fly their 3D printer to the ISS, In May, NASA and Made In Space announced the 3D Printing in Zero-G Experiment, which would put their 3D printer on ISS.
In May 2014, NASA awarded Made In Space a Phase 1 SBIR contract for the development of a recycler unit, to use with the 3D printer on ISS, and for their microwell project. Shortly after, Made In Space was awarded an ISS Space Flight Awareness Award. This award honors "teams that have significantly improved the efficiency, cost or capabilities of space flight."
In June 2014, Made In Space, Inc. showcased their in-space manufacturing capabilities at the White House Maker Faire. The company was nominated as a World Technology Network Award Finalist, in August 2014, in the corporate IT hardware category.
On Sunday, September 21, 2014 at 1:52 a.m. EDT (0552 GMT), Made In Space's Zero-G printer was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida to ISS, on board Space X CRS-4. On November 17, astronaut Barry “Butch” Wilmore unpacked the 3D printer from its launch packaging. On November 24, at approximately 1:28pm PST, Made In Space successfully printed the first part ever manufactured in space. On December 11, 2014, at Autodesk University 2014, Chef Strategy Officer and co-founder, Mike Chen, revealed Made In Space's first functional application, a buckle developed by NASA astronaut Yvonne Cagle. This buckle is part of exercise equipment to assist with the reduction of muscle loss in zero gravity environments.
On December 12, 2014 the Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum re-opened after 3 years of renovation, as the new Cooper Hewitt. Dedicated to contemporary and historic design, Made In Space's 3D printer was one of their grand re-opening exhibits, in their Tools: Extending Our Reach exhibit area. The Zero-G printer was featured along with replicas of 13 of the first 21 objects printed in space and a replica of the plate affixed to the printer, which was created by Jon Lomberg, the artist who designed Voyager's Golden Record.
On December 17, 2014, the first uplinked tool, a ratchet, was manufactured on ISS. Prior to the print of the ratchet, all of the other items manufactured were previously printed on the printer, before it launched, and the files were available via an SD card launched with the printer. The ratchet files were uplinked from the Made In Space office to the ISS space station. The ratchet took four hours to print.


== 3D Printing in Zero-G Technology Demonstration ==
Announced in May 2013, NASA and Made In Space partnered to send the first 3D printer to space, known as the 3D Printing in Zero-G Technology Demonstration (also known as 3D Printing in Zero-G Experiment or 3D Printing in Zero-G). The scientific objective of this experiment is to prove a 3D printer could be developed for use in zero gravity. This experiment "is the first step towards establishing an on-demand machine shop in space, a critical enabling component for deep-space crewed missions and in-space manufacturing."
Integrated into a Microgravity Science Glovebox (MSG), 3D Printing in Zero-G is a proof of concept experiment. It includes printing multiple copies of planned items to test for several variables, including: dimensions, layer adhesion, tensile strength, flexibility and compressional strength. Known as "coupons", these items will be tested by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and compared to duplicate items printed on Earth. The comparisons of these space and terrestrial manufactured coupons will be used to further refine future 3D printing in space.


=== The Jon Lomberg Golden Plate ===
Inspired by Jon Lomberg's work on the Voyager Golden Record, Lomberg worked with Made In Space to create the Golden Plate, to help commemorate the first manufacturing of something in space. It is attached internally, so it is visible through the front viewing window.
The Golden Plate features imagery that symbolizes both the 3D Printing in Zero-G project, but also the individuals who have been instrumental in bringing the project to fruition. These features include: 27 stars, which represents 16 key contributors from the Marshall Space Flight Center, 10 key Made In Space, Inc. employees and Jon Lomberg, 1 comet to symbolize all of the other people who supported Made In Space and Star Trek character, Jean Luc Picard's catchphrase, "Make it so" in binary, symbolizing the functionality the 3D printer brings to ISS.


== Additive Manufacturing Facility ==
The Additive Manufacturing Facility (AMF) is scheduled for deployment in 2015. This Nanoracks facility, featuring Made In Space's Zero-G printer, will be used to manufacture parts both for NASA and other space agencies, as needed on ISS. In addition, additive space manufacturing will also be commercially, with the AMF, for anyone around the world.


== Recycling of 3D Printer Plastic ==
NASA in 2014 selected Made In Space as one of several companies to develop a recycler for 3D printed material on the ISS. In the follow up solicitation Made In Space failed to be selected for the Phase II SBIR.


== Dr. Cagle's Buckle ==
One of the first functional parts to be manufactured in space will be a buckle designed by NASA astronaut Dr. Yvonne Cagle. Used with stretchable material already on ISS, this buckle will be used to gauge lactic acid in muscles, during exercise. By relocating this lactic acid, astronauts will be able to exercise more efficiently and effectively, preventing muscle atrophy and improving cardiovascular health of astronauts. Prior to the ability to manufacture the buckle in space, one of the design concerns was making it strong enough to withstand the forces of launch. Now, the lightweight buckle is designed for functionality, without the launch forces concerns.
