Cloud.com


Cloud.com was a venture-backed software company based in Cupertino, California that developed open source software for the implementation of public and private cloud computing environments. Its software, CloudStack, is designed to make it easier for service providers and enterprises to build, manage and deploy offerings similar to Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3. CloudStack is available in three editions: the Enterprise Edition, the Service Provider Edition and the open-source Community Edition.
In July 2011, Cloud.com was acquired by Citrix Systems. The CloudStack software then became available under Apache Software License and further development governed by the Apache Foundation.

== History ==
Cloud.com was first registered in 1992 as a BBS system offering telnet, ftp, lynx, gopher and archie services, "Cloud City Online" by John Bilik in Lake Zurich, Il. The domain was hijacked several years later and sold multiple times. VMOps was founded by Sheng Liang, Shannon Williams, Alex Huang, Will Chan, and Chiradeep Vittal in 2008. The company raised a total of $17.6M in venture funding from Redpoint Ventures, Nexus Ventures and Index Ventures (Redpoint and Nexus led the initial Series A funding round).
The company changed its name from VMOps to Cloud.com on May 4, 2010, when it emerged from stealth mode by announcing its product. In July 2010, Cloud.com became a founding member of the OpenStack initiative. In October 2010, Cloud.com announced a partnership with Microsoft to develop the code to provide integration and support of Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V to the OpenStack project.
In July 2011, Cloud.com was acquired by Citrix Systems.
