== History ==
Thorsten von Eicken, a former professor of computer science at Cornell University, left to manage systems architecture for Expertcity, the startup company that became Citrix Online. He was joined by RightScale CEO Michael Crandell, and RightScale Vice President of Engineering Rafael Saavedra.
RightScale received $4.5 million in venture capital in April 2008, $13 million in December 2008 and $25 million in September 2010.
On July 18, 2012, RightScale announced its acquisition of the Scotland-based PlanForCloud.com (formerly ShopForCloud.com), which provides a free cloud cost forecasting service.
RightScale introduced the Cloud Maturity Model with the release of its second annual State of the Cloud Report on April 25, 2013. The report findings are based on a RightScale survey of 625 IT decision makers and categorized according to the Cloud Maturity Model, which is an analysis and segmentation of companies based on their varying degrees of cloud adoption.
On October 2, 2015, just before the industry's biggest trade show, Amazon re:Invent, Crandell announced that RightScale's new vision will be to "manage any cloud, any service, any virtual machine, any server, and any container." This expanded vision, which RightScale calls "universal cloud management," is inspired by the goal of "enabling as many cloud-like capabilities as possible for each environment." Examples include the RightScale Cloud Appliance for vSphere ("RCA-V"), the RightScale Universal Cloud Appliance ("UCA"), RightScale Cloud Services Plugins, and support for the developing container ecosystem.


== Partnerships with other companies ==

On November 5, 2012, RightScale announced that it was expanding its existing relationship with cloud hosting provider Rackspace to integrate with Rackspace Open Cloud products powered by OpenStack.
In February 2013, RightScale became the first cloud management company to resell Google Compute Engine public cloud infrastructure.
On April 15, 2013, RightScale announced that it would provide enterprise support for Windows Azure in conjunction with the Microsoft announcement of its general availability release of Windows Azure Infrastructure Services.
