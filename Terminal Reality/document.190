== History ==
T-Systems was founded in 2000, when Deutsche Telekom acquired a 50.1% stake of debis Systemhaus, one of the largest IT services companies in Germany at the time. Most of Deutsche Telekom's existing service and IT businesses were then merged and incorporated under the control of one single company, the newly founded T-Systems. In 2001 T-System's headquarters were moved from Bonn to Frankfurt, a major IT centre in Germany. In 2002 the remaining 49.9% share of debis Systemhaus was acquired and fully incorporated into T-Systems.
However, the company underwent a leadership crisis during the first years after its creation, due to different agendas of the former debis management and the leadership of the former Telekom subsidiaries. Since then, T-Systems made a number of acquisitions, most notably the purchase of gedas, the IT subsidiary of Volkswagen Group in December 2005. Since 2007, Reinhard Clemens is T-Systems' new CEO. T-Systems also supported the creation of Silicon Saxony, a major IT cluster in Germany.
In 2008 T-Systems and global IT services provider, Cognizant, have entered into a global alliance. T-Systems' India operations were taken over by Cognizant following this alliance in late March, 2008. T-Systems is also working for the German government and a market leader in Germany.
In 2009, T-Systems came with another wing in India (T-Systems ICT India Pvt. Ltd.) to support its global partner Volkswagen for their manufacturing plant in Chakan,Pune. T-Systems ICT India has its head office in Viman Nagar, Pune and is expanding to provide its ICT services to other consumers in India. Since 2012 Amit Goel is the Business Head of T-Systems ICT India. Before that, Vivek Krishnatray managed the company's Indian operations.
