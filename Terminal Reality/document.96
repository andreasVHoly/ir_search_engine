Sculpteo offers online printing services, particularly in Europe and North America


== Purpose ==
Sculpteo offers an online 3D printing service for professionals and individuals. From a 3D file, Sculpteo manufactures real objects such as interior decoration, figurines, robots, miniatures, scale models... It also gives access to a 3D design market. Since 2012, Sculpteo offers mobile applications which can generate 3D files and order their manufacture directy from the smartphone. With its offer of 3D printing for professionals as well as for the general public, Sculpteo gives individuals access to 3D printing in an original form which integrates professional designers in the chain of production.
