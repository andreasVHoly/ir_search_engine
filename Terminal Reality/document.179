VCloud Air


vCloud Air is a public cloud platform built on vSphere from VMware. vCloud Air has three infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) subscription service types: dedicated cloud, virtual private cloud, and disaster recovery. vCloud Air also offers a pay-as-you-go service named Virtual Private Cloud OnDemand.


== vCloud History ==
VMware announced the vCloud initiative at the 2008 VMworld conference in Las Vegas and garnered significant press attention.
At the 2009 VMworld conference in San Francisco vCloud was featured in the vCloud Pavilion. vCloud was also a subject at the 2010 VMworld conference.
On May 21, 2013, the early access program for vCloud Hybrid Service was launched. On August 26, 2013, general availability was announced for vCloud Hybrid Service including features such as DRaaS and Direct Connect.
vCloud Hybrid Service was rebranded to vCloud Air on August 21, 2014. vCloud Air provides a hybrid cloudâ€”a public IaaS that functions as an extension of existing data centers running VMware vSphere, with common management and networking. With the rebrand of the service, they also announced a cloud computing On Demand program  that allows users to pay only for what each user needs to use for resources.
vCloud Air Mobile was announced on August 25, 2014 which adds the integration of AirWatch and Pivotal Cloud Foundry into the platform.


== Data Center Locations ==
Similar to other public cloud providers, vCloud Air supports the concept of regions - or locations, in vCloud terminology - which are typically used to leverage better pricing, to increase application performance or as disaster recovery. vCloud Air is offered to the public in California, Nevada, Texas, Virginia and New Jersey in the United States. Internationally, it is available in the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and Australia.
Government users have access to two additional locations: one in Arizona, and another in Virginia.


== Architecture ==
vCloud Air supports more than 5,000 applications and 90+ operating systems certified to run on vSphere. The use of vCloud Air allows seamless workload portability and migration due to vSphere, which means no rewrites or recoding when moving workloads from an on-premises data center to the cloud and vice versa.
Network virtualization allows users to configure firewalls and network to mirror on-site networks, including NAT rules and firewall rules, networks, and public IPs.


== Virtual Private Cloud OnDemand ==

This infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) pay-as-you-go offering allows users to consume specific vCPU, storage, vRAM, Network and IP as needed.
