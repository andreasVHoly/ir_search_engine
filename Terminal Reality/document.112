AstroPrint


AstroPrint is a suite of software and services, designed for 3D printing by 3DaGoGo Inc., a private San Diego based technology company. AstroPrint develops software to enable the management of 3D printing from any web enabled device.
AstroPrint works by taking a user's uploaded STL file, adding supports, slicing it, and saving the g-code in the user's account online. The user can then access, download, modify, and print their models wirelessly via their 3D printer. AstroPrint is built with a combination of 3D printing software, such as Cura, Repetier Host, Slic3r, and OctoPrint.
AstroPrint is compatible with most consumer 3D printers and its open source software can be run on a Raspberry Pi.

In May 2014, while part of the Betaspring seed accelerator, AstroPrint successfully raised $40,314 and met their funding goal in a single day using the crowdfunding website Kickstarter. Subsequently, AstroPrint attended and graduated from the 500 Startups seed accelerator in Mountain View, CA.
AstroPrint maintains partnerships with National Institutes of Health, 3D Hubs, i.materialise and 3D Slash.
3D printer manufacturer Airwolf 3D ships 3D Printers with AstroPrint software integrated.
Investors of AstroPrint include Dave McClure, Will Bunker, Dave Hodson (Co-Founder & CTO of MessageCast Inc.) and Christine Tsai.


== Media coverage ==
On May 18, 2015, AstroPrint won the Editors Choice award by Maker Faire & Make Magazine.
On July 27, 2015, San Diego Business Journal wrote that AstroPrint was instrumental in enabling Dr. Peter Manning at the National Institutes of Health in printing 3-dimensional models of a two-year-old boy's heart and the network of vessels that caused his breathing problems. AstroPrint reduced the hundreds of settings usually required by 3D printers to three.
Tech Cocktail named AstroPrint under 3D Printing for "The Top 5 Technologies VCs Will Fund in 2015".
On January 5, 2016, AstroPrint unveiled a joint project with $3 billion technology giant Marvell at CES 2016 in Las Vegas, Nevada. The project involved the designing of a consumer friendly 3D Printer containing embedded software by AstroPrint using the Kinoma platform. According to journalists and media personnel, the printer was only accessible on an invite only basis in a private ballroom within CES.
