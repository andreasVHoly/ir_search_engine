Francesco Mondada (born 17 March 1967) is a Swiss professor in artificial intelligence and robotics. He got a Master's degree in Microengineering at the EPFL in 1991 and a Ph.D. degree in 1997. He is one of the creators of the Khepera and directed the design of the S-bot, the e-puck, the marXbot and the Thymio mobile robots. Together, these robots are mentioned in more than 7000 research articles. In particular the Khepera robot is a milestone in the field of bio-inspired and evolutionary robotics.
He was one of the founders and director of K-team SA from its creation 1995 to 2000, and one of the founders of Calerga Sarl in 2001 and Mobsya in 2010. He has received several industrial and academic prizes, including the University Latsis and the Credit Suisse Award for Best Teaching.
His recent work concerns collective robotics and education.
