== Contemporary psychoanalysis ==
Fonagy received the Otto Weininger Memorial Award for his contributions to the development of contemporary psychoanalysis. To this regard he has helped to improve the dialogue between analysts and cognitive therapists. Fonagy has played and still plays a major role in the evaluation of psychotherapy research. The evaluation of his research is (mostly) based on the effectiveness of treatment. Evaluation of treatment has led to review, recommendations and implications of psychotherapy. Fonagy has offered detailed evidence for the efficacy of psychological interventions of mental disorders and for special populations, including treatment of borderline personality disorder.


== Mentalization ==
In their award winning book Affect Regulation, Mentalisation and the Development of the Self, Fonagy and his colleagues put forth a detailed theory for the way in which the abilities to mentalise and to regulate affect can determine an individual's successful development. They define mentalisation as the ability to make and use mental representations of their own and other people's emotional states. The authors discuss the ways in which bad and insufficient parenting, leading to certain attachment styles, can leave children unable to modulate and interpret their own feelings, as well as the feelings of others. These inabilities to mentalise and regulate affect have implications for severe personality disorders, as well as general psychological problems of self-confidence, and sense of self.


== Mentalization-based treatment ==
Fonagy is particularly interested in borderline personality disorder, which was for a long time assumed to be treatment-resistant. He and A. Bateman proposed in their book Psychotherapy for borderline personality disorder: mentalisation based treatment, a new way to treat BPD. Mentalization based treatment (MBT), rooted in attachment theory, is based on the idea that people with borderline personality disorder mainly lack the ability to mentalise, which is caused by an absence of contingent and marked mirroring during development. The primary goals of treatment are to improve mentalisation skills, making connections between the inner experience of relationships and the actual representation, learning how to work with current emotions and how to establish real relationships. In this way they could form a more coherent sense of self and develop new (secure) attachment styles.
