3D Print Canal House


The 3D Print Canal House is a three-year publicly accessible "Research & Design by Doing" project in which an international team of partners from various sectors works together on 3D printing a canal house in Amsterdam.
By building the house, all parties research the possibilities of 3D printing architecture and form connections between design, science, culture, building, software, communities and the city. The project serves as both an exhibition of 3D printing technology, as well as a research site into 3D printing architecture. The project is initiated by DUS architects and the site, in Amsterdam North, opened to the public on March 1, 2014.


== Kamermaker ==
The house is being constructed by a machine called the KamerMaker ("RoomBuilder") which implies how the house will be built: room-by-room. The house is printed with the KamerMaker â€“ a gigantic FDM printer that can print elements of 2 x 2 x 3,5 meters, developed by DUS. It is a movable pavilion which has the size of a shipping container. The machine can print components up to 2.2 by 2.2 by 3.5 meters in size. The machine itself is 6 meters tall. The Kamermaker can be moved by a truck or ship.
