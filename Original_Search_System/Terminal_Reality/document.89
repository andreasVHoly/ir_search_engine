Materialise NV


Materialise NV, headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, is active in the field of additive manufacturing, also known as 3D Printing.


== History ==
Materialise was founded in June 1990 by Wilfried Vancraen as a spin-off of the KU Leuven, becoming the first Rapid Prototyping Service Bureau in the Benelux region. What was then known as Rapid Prototyping is now known as Additive Manufacturing or 3D Printing, a three-dimensional printing technique that starts from a 3D CAD drawing and results in a three-dimensional object manufactured in a wide range of plastics, stainless steel, titanium, and a growing range of other materials.
Since its foundation, Materialise has steadily grown and today has offices in many countries on five continents. Major offices and software development centers are in Belgium (HQ), the United States, Germany, China, Ukraine and Malaysia. In 2014, Materialise made an IPO at NASDAQ.


== Software ==
Following its conception, Materialise concentrated on the research and development of solutions for the transfer of data to Additive Manufacturing machines. In 1991, the company released Mimics and in 1992, Magics. Mimics calculates surface 3D models from stacked image data such as Computed Tomography (CT), Confocal Microscopy, Micro CT, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) through image segmentation. Magics imports data from CAD formats and exports 3D printable files in the STL format. Their suite of industrial software now includes data preparation and design optimization tools, programs to integrate 3D printing into production environments, and software and control systems used by machine manufacturers to bridge the gap between applications and 3D printers.


== Manufacturing center ==
Materialise runs the biggest 3D printing service in Europe. It encompasses over 130 machines, producing more than 700,000 parts per year. Offered manufacturing processes include Selective Laser Sintering, Stereolithography, Fused deposition modeling, multi-jet modeling and vacuum casting (with 3D printed casts).
There are two types of web services associated with the manufacturing center. Some industrial customers order parts for themselves, whether prototypes or functional parts, through OnSite. On the other hand, designers and small businesses can upload designs to the i.materialise 3D printing marketplace.


== Medical 3D Printing & biomedical engineering ==
Materialise is active in the field of medical 3D Printing and biomedical engineering. Main fields of application are surgical drilling and cutting guides and 3D-printed replicas of internal organs (such as the heart, kidneys, liver, etc.) based on CT or MRI data.


== Mammoth stereolithography ==

In order to build single-piece Stereolithography models with dimensions of more than 2 meters, Materialise developed Mammoth Stereolithography. The build area of the largest Mammoth machine is 2100x700x800mm. Applications include a replica of King Tut's body, based on CT data, producing what could otherwise only be seen by unwrapping the mummy.


== Applications ==
The technology at Materialise is being used by professionals in the automotive, aerospace, consumer electronics, consumables, orthopaedic, cardiovascular, cranio-maxillofacial, and dental industries, as well as in architecture, fashion, jewelry, art, and more.
