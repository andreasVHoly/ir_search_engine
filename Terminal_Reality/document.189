Linode


Linode (a portmanteau of the words linux and node) is a privately owned virtual private server provider based in Galloway, New Jersey.


== History ==
Linode was founded by Christopher Aker, launching in mid 2003.
Linode transitioned from UML to Xen virtualization in March 2008, and then to KVM in mid-2015. It launched its data backup service in 2009. NodeBalancer, a load-balancing service, launched in July 2011. Linode released Linode Managed, an incident response service designed for businesses, in 2013.
Its Dallas, Texas and Fremont, California data centers opened in 2003. Linode also opened an Atlanta, Georgia data center in 2007; a Newark, New Jersey-based center in 2008; its London, England center in 2009; a Tokyo, Japan center in 2011; and a Frankfurt, Germany center in 2015.


== Products and services ==
Linode offers multiple products and services for its clients. Its flagship products are cloud-hosting services with multiple packages at different price points. Linode Backup allows customers to backup their servers on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Linode Manager and NodeBalancer both allow users to manage multiple server instances across a single system. In September 2013, Linode launched Longview, an analysis package for Linux.


== Security concerns ==
The accounts of eight Linode customers that held Bitcoin electronic currency were compromised in March 2012. Roughly 40,000 bitcoins were stolen.
Hack The Planet accessed the Linode’s web servers in 2013. The group exploited a technical vulnerability in Adobe’s ColdFusion application server. Linode said that HTP could not decrypt any financially sensitive information and reset all account passwords. Linode announced plans to introduce two-step authentication for its services in May 2013.
Starting Christmas Day 2015 and continuing until January 10th, Linode was hit by large and frequent DDoS attacks, which were being caused by a "bad actor" purchasing large amounts of botnet capacity in an attempt to significantly damage Linode’s business.
