NetMiner is an application software for exploratory analysis and visualization of large network data based on SNA(Social Network Analysis). It can be used for general research and teaching in social networks. This tool allows researchers to explore their network data visually and interactively, helps them to detect underlying patterns and structures of the network. It features data transformation, network analysis, statistics, visualization of network data, chart, and a programming language based on the Python script language. It has been released in 2001 as a commercial analysis software specialized in social network analysis. There are various license not only for commercial use, but also for non-commercial academic use. NetMiner 4 license for coursework is provided to students and teachers for free if answering a questionnaire. The current version is 4 for Microsoft Windows (2000 or later version).

== Data structure ==


=== Hierarchy of NetMiner data structure ===
A DataSet is a basic unit in NetMiner and used as an input data for all the analysis and visualization Modules. A DataSet is composed of four types of data items: Main Nodeset, Sub Nodeset, 1-mode Network data and 2-mode Network data. A DataSet can have only one Main Nodeset. But multiple 1-mode Network data can be contained in a DataSet. Moreover, a DataSet contains multiple Sub Nodesets and multiple 2-mode Network data. ProcessLogs which are generated by analysis and visualization process can be managed with a DataSet in a Workfile. A Project contains independent multiple Workfiles. A number of nodes in Main NodeSet of each workfile does not need to be the same. In this way, the hierarchy of NetMiner data structure is as follow:


== Script workbench in NetMiner 4 ==
NetMiner 4 equips script workbench based on Python script language with script generator which enables users to generate a programmable script automatically. Then users can operate functions in NetMiner 4 by using GUI or programmable script language. Most functions of NetMiner can be performed using script rather than clicking menu so that complicated series of commands can be stored in script and executed repeatedly. Various existing libraries written by Python can be applicable within NetMiner 4 without any modifications, and ordinary data structures which were provided by Python can be defined. Users can develop their own algorithms by combinations of NetMiner features. A generated script file can be added to NetMiner 4 as a one of menu by a form of plug-in which can be shared with other NetMiner users. Using loops, conditionals, in-depth analysis is available. And users can create and use a batch file which is executed automatically for NetMiner.
