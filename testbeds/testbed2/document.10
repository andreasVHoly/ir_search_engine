The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to artificial intelligence: Artificial intelligence (AI) – intelligence exhibited by machines or software. It is also the name of the academic field which studies how to create computers and computer software that are capable of intelligent behaviour. == What type of thing is artificial intelligence? == Artificial intelligence can be described as all of the following: A misnomer – something named in error. Artificial grass isn't genuinely grass, but that doesn't apply to artificial intelligence. If a computer program is intelligent, its intelligence is real. See "synthetic intelligence", below. A form of intelligence Synthetic intelligence – intelligence of a man-made yet real quality: actual, not fake, not simulated A type of technology A type of computer technology A computer program that performs some intellectual function An emerging technology A field: An academic discipline A branch of science A branch of applied science A branch of computer science == Types of artificial intelligence == Weak AI – non-sentient computer intelligence, typically focused on a narrow task. The intelligence of weak AI is limited. Artificial general intelligence (strong AI) – hypothetical artificial intelligence at least as smart as a human. Such an AI would be recursive, in that it could improve itself. In successive intervals of increased intelligence, such an entity could theoretically achieve superintelligence in a relatively short period of time. One or more superintelligences could potentially change the world so profoundly and at such a high rate, that it may result in a technological singularity. Strong AI does not yet exist. The prospect of its creation inspires expections of both promise and peril, and has become the subject of an intense ongoing ethical debate. == Branches of artificial intelligence == === By approach === Symbolic AI – When access to digital computers became possible in the middle 1950s, AI research began to explore the possibility that human intelligence could be reduced to symbol manipulation.

This phenomenon has occurred in relation to every AI application produced throughout the history of development of AI. AI winter – Moore's Law – observation that, over the history of computing hardware, the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit has doubled approximately every two years. One way this relates to AI is that hypothetically a computer would need at least as much capacity as a human brain to be able to be programmed to be as smart as a human. So as long as the aforementioned rate of development met or beat the 2-year doubling time, one could roughly forecast when a computer would have as much memory and calculation capacity as a human brain, a milestone which was reached in 2010. Though it may take as much as 3 magnitudes (1000 times) more computer capacity (since computers calculate things in a much more linear fashion) to emulate the massively parallel structure of the human brain. At a doubling time of 2 years, an increase in capacity by 1000-fold would take a little less than 18 years (9 doublings), if reaching the limit of integrated circuit technology did not pose an obstacle before then. == AI safety == Existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence Friendly AI – hypothetical AI that is designed not to harm humans and to prevent unfriendly AI from being developed AI takeover – point at which humans are no longer the dominant form of intelligence on Earth and machine intelligence is Superintelligence – AI may grow to such an advanced state to become as proportionately superior to humans as humans are to ants. Theoretically, there would be little humans could do to prevent such an intelligence from reaching its goals. Intelligence explosion – through recursive self-improvement and self-replication, the magnitude of intelligent machinery could surpass human ability to resist it. Artificial intelligence as a global catastrophic risk == AI and the future == Artificial general intelligence (Strong AI) – hypothetical artificial intelligence that matches or exceeds human intelligence — an intelligent machine that could perform intellectual tasks at least as well as a human Aspects or features Self-replicating machines – smart computers and robots would be able to make more of themselves, in a geometric progression or via mass production. Or smart programs may be uploaded into hardware existing at the time (because linear architecture of sufficient speeds could be used to emulate massively parallel analog systems such as human brains). Recursive self improvement (aka seed AI) – speculative ability of strong artificial intelligence to reprogram itself to make itself even more intelligent. The more intelligent it got, the more capable it would be of further improving itself, in successively more rapid iterations, potentially resulting in an intelligence explosion leading to the emergence of a superintelligence. Hive mind – Robot swarm – Technological singularity – the development of strong AI may cause an intelligence explosion in which greater-than-human intelligence emerges, radically changing civilization, and perhaps even human nature. The TS has been identified by Berglas (2012) and others to be an existential risk. Singularitarianism – Human enhancement – humans may be enhanced, either by the efforts of AI or by merging with it. Transhumanism – philosophy of human transformation Posthumanism – people may survive, but not be recognizable in comparison to present modern-day humans.
