Andrew Yan-Tak Ng (traditional Chinese: 吳恩達; simplified Chinese: 吴恩达; pinyin: Wú Ēndá; born 1976) is Chief Scientist at Baidu Research in Silicon Valley. In addition, he is an associate professor in the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Electrical Engineering by courtesy at Stanford University. He is chairman of the board of Coursera, an online education platform that he co-founded with Daphne Koller.
He researches primarily in machine learning and deep learning. His early work includes the Stanford Autonomous Helicopter project, which developed one of the most capable autonomous helicopters in the world, and the STAIR (STanford Artificial Intelligence Robot) project, which resulted in ROS, a widely used open-source robotics software platform.
Ng is also the author or co-author of over 100 published papers in machine learning, robotics and related fields, and some of his work in computer vision has been featured in a series of press releases and reviews. In 2008, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35. In 2007, Ng was awarded a Sloan Fellowship. For his work in Artificial Intelligence, he is also a recipient of the Computers and Thought Award (2009).
On May 16, 2014, Ng announced from his Coursera blog that he would be stepping away from his day-to-day responsibilities at Coursera, and join Baidu as Chief Scientist, working on deep learning.


== Biography ==
Ng was born in the UK in 1976. His parents were both Hongkongers. He spent time in Hong Kong and Singapore and later graduated from Raffles Institution in Singapore in 1992. In 1997, he received his undergraduate degree in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Ng earned his master's degree from Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1998 and received his PhD from University of California, Berkeley in 2002. He started working at Stanford University during that year and currently lives in Palo Alto, California. He married Carol E. Reiley  in 2014.


== Machine learning research ==
In 2011, Ng founded the Google Brain project at Google, which developed very large scale artificial neural networks using Google's distributed computer infrastructure. Among its notable results was a neural network trained using deep learning algorithms on 16,000 CPU cores, that learned to recognize higher-level concepts, such as cats, after watching only YouTube videos, and without ever having been told what a "cat" is. The project's technology is currently also used in the Android Operating System's speech recognition system.


== Online education ==
Ng started the Stanford Engineering Everywhere (SEE) program, which in 2008 placed a number of Stanford courses online, for free. Ng taught one of these courses, Machine Learning, which consisted of video lectures by him, along with the student materials used in the Stanford CS229 class.
The "applied" version of the Stanford class (CS229a) was hosted on ml-class.org and started in October 2011, with over 100,000 students registered for its first iteration; the course featured quizzes and graded programming assignments and became one of the first successful MOOCs made by Stanford professors. His work subsequently led to the founding of Coursera in 2012.
