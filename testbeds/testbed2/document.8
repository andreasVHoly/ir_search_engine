The European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence (ECCAI) is the representative body for the European artificial intelligence community. Its aim is to promote study, research, and applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in Europe. It was established in 1982.


== Activities ==
Every even-numbered year, ECCAI, jointly with one of the member associations of ECCAI, holds the European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI). The conference has become the leading conference for this field in Europe. The list of ECAI proceedings is available here.


== Fellowship ==
The ECCAI Fellows program has been started in 1999 to recognize individuals who have made significant, sustained contributions to the field of artificial intelligence (AI) in Europe. Fellows' accomplishments range from pioneering advances in the theory of AI, to unusual accomplishments in AI technology and applications. Usually only individuals who have made contributions to AI for a decade or more after receiving their Ph.D. (or are at an equivalent career stage) will be selected. Leadership in ECCAI or ECCAI member societies, support of forums for the exchange of ideas, and extended service for the international AI community also play a role in the selection process. Evidence of technical contribution will often be in the form of publications, but other evidence will also be considered, such as patent awards or statements of longstanding contribution to an industrial group effort. The ECCAI Fellows Program honors only a very small percentage of the total membership of all ECCAI member societies (up to a maximum of 3%).
The policies governing the operation of the Fellows Committee are under the review of the ECCAI Board.


== Dissertation Award ==
The Artificial Intelligence Dissertation Award sponsored by ECCAI, the European Coordinating Committee for Artificial Intelligence is awarded since 1998.


== Member Societies ==
There is a collection of member societies which are national AI societies in European countries.
