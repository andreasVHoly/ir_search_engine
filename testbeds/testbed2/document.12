Artificial intelligence applications have been used in a wide range of fields including medical diagnosis, stock trading, robot control, law, scientific discovery and toys. However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: "A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore." "Many thousands of AI applications are deeply embedded in the infrastructure of every industry." In the late 1990s and early 21st century, AI technology became widely used as elements of larger systems, but the field is rarely credited for these successes.
To allow comparison with human performance, artificial intelligence can be evaluated on constrained and well-defined problems. Such tests have been termed subject matter expert Turing tests. Also, smaller problems provide more achievable goals and there are an ever-increasing number of positive results.


== Performance evaluation ==
The broad classes of outcome for an AI test are:
optimal: it is not possible to perform better
strong super-human: performs better than all humans
super-human: performs better than most humans
par-human: performs similarly to most humans
sub-human: performs worse than most humans


== Optimal ==

Tic-Tac-Toe
Connect Four
Checkers
Rubik's Cube
Heads-up limit hold'em poker: statistically optimal in the sense that "a human lifetime of play is not sufficient to establish with statistical significance that the strategy is not an exact solution". Sub-human for full ring Texas hold 'em; approaching strong super-human in simpler versions of poker.


== Strong super-human ==
Bridge: nearing strong super-human
Chess: nearing strong super-human
Go: nearing strong super-human; better than European Go champion
Jigsaw puzzles: strong super-human
Reversi: strong super-human
Scrabble: strong super-human
Quiz show question answering: strong super-human


== Super-human ==
Backgammon: super-human
Crosswords: super-human
Driving a car: super-human. Google driverless cars are safer and smoother when steering themselves than when a human takes the wheel.
Arimaa: super-human


== Par-human ==
Optical character recognition for ISO 1073-1:1976 and similar special characters.
Classification of images


== Sub-human ==
Optical character recognition for printed text (nearing par-human for Latin-script typewritten text)
Handwriting recognition
Object recognition
Translation
Speech recognition
Word-sense disambiguation
Natural language processing
