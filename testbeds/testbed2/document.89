Hod Lipson (born 1967 in Haifa, Israel) is an American robotics engineer. He is the director of Cornell University's Creative Machines Lab (CCML), formerly known as Computational Synthesis Lab (CCSL), at the Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Lipson's work focuses on evolutionary robotics, design automation, rapid prototyping, artificial life, and creating machines that can demonstrate some aspects of human creativity. His publications have been cited close to 10,000 times, and he has an h-index of 50, as of November 8, 2015.


== Biography ==
Lipson received B.Sc. (1989) and Ph.D. (1998) degrees in Mechanical Engineering from Technion Israel Institute of Technology. Before joining the faculty of Cornell in 2001, he was an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at Brandeis University's, and a postdoctoral researcher at MIT's Mechanical Engineering Department.


== Research ==
Lipson has been involved with machine learning and presented his "self-aware" robot at the 2007 TED conference. 
Beginning in 2009, he and his Cornell University graduate student Michael Schmidt developed software named Eureqa capable of deriving equations, mathematical relationships and laws of nature from sets of data: for instance, deriving Newton's second law of motion from a data set of positions and velocities of a double pendulum. In 2011, it was reported that Eureqa had succeeded at a much more complex task: re-deriving seven equations describing how levels of various chemical compounds fluctuate in oxygen-deprived yeast cells.
Lipson has been involved with teams that have created a number of machines including:
Fab@Home fabbers—low cost "3-d printers"
Self replicating robots—simple structures capable of reproducing themselves given the appropriate parts.
"self aware robots"—machines capable of compensating for damage that would otherwise impede movement.
Molecubes self-reproducing robots.
