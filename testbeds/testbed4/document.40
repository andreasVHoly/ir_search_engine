In the second case study presented here (Fig. 6), a
camera navigates through a model city, viewing the
scene from a wide range of angles and locations. In
order to keep the number of occluders low, each
building is associated with a single though suboptimal
occluder. Using three box occluders instead
of one, would have resulted in a more tight fitting of
the geometry and therefore better culling results. The
scene complexity of modeled environment is very
balanced with regard to the view-direction due to the
uniform distribution of three-dimensional models in
space. As can be verified by the measured visible
primitives at each path location, in this dense
environment, there is an almost constant performance
ratio between the solid and the planar occlusion
culling method.
Apart from the computational cost of the geometry frustum
containment test, which is common to both
planar and solid occluder methods, the overhead

introduced by the solid occluders comes from the
determination of the visible edges of a convex solid,
at each frame (see statistics in Table 1 and 2). In
practice, this overhead is negligible because the
silhouette is computed for very few and simple solid
objects. This is ensured by the selection mechanism
discussed in section 3.
The solid occluders culling method is an approximate
algorithm, whose accuracy, compared to exact
visibility calculation methods, depends on the
selection of the occluders. In general, as occluders
are enclosed in the shell of the actual geometric
entities, the method is conservative, i.e. visibility is
overestimated.
5. CONCLUSION
Even though the speed of today’s graphics cards is
increasing at a phenomenal rate, it will always be the
case that researchers and game developers alike
would like to push more geometry through the
graphics pipeline than the card can handle at
acceptable frame rates. Removing non-visible
geometry before it reaches the pipeline
