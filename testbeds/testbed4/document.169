Phong shading

In 3D graphics, a technique developed by Phong Bui-Tuong in the mid-1970s that computes a shaded surface based on the color and illumination at each pixel. Phong shading is more realistic than Gouraud shading, but requires more computation. It does not produce shadows or reflections. The surface normals at the triangle's points are used to compute a surface normal for each pixel, which in turn creates a more accurate RGB value for each pixel. See flat shading and Gouraud shading.

Phong-shaded Image
This 1000-ton, 65-foot high nuclear reactor vessel in Sweden was rendered with Phong shading in MicroStation MasterPiece from Bentley Systems. For lighting effects, 86 different light sources were applied with various colors and settings. (Image courtesy of Bentley Systems, Inc. and Rolf Granstrom, ABB Tekniska Rontgencentralen AB.)
