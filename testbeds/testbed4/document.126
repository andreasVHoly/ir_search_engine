Catmull-Rom Splines Catmull-Rom Splines interpolate degree-3 curves with C1 continuity and are made up of cubic curves.
A user speci?es only the points [¯ p1,...¯ pN] for interpolation, and the tangent at each point is set to be parallel to the vector between adjacent points. So the tangent at ¯ pj is ?(¯ pj+1 - ¯ pj-1) (for

Between two points, ¯ pj and ¯ pj+1, we draw a cubic curve using ¯ pj, ¯ pj+1, and two auxiliary points on the tangents, ?(¯ pj+1 - ¯ pj-1) and ?(¯ pj+2 - ¯ pj). We want to ?nd the coef?cients aj when x(t) = 1 t t2 t3  a0 a1 a2 a3 T, where the curve is de?ned as ¯ c(t) = c(t) y(t) (similarly for y(t) and bj). For the curve between ¯ pj and ¯ pj+1, assume we know two end points, ¯ c(0) and ¯ c(1) and their tangents, ~c'(0) and ~c'(1). That is, x(0) = xj, (120) x(1) = xj+1, (121) x'(0) = ?(xj+1 -xj-1), (122) x'(1) = ?(xj+2 -xj). (123) To solve for~a, set up the linear system, ? ? ? ? x(0) x(1) x'(0) x'(1) ? ? ? ? = ? ? ? ? 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 2 3 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? a0 a1 a2 a3 ? ? ? ? .

For the ?rst tangent in the curve, we cannot use the above formula. Instead, we use:
~t1 = ?(¯ p2 - ¯ p1) (127)
and, for the last tangent:
~tN = ?(¯ pN - ¯ pN-1) (128)

15 Parametric Curves And Surfaces
15.1 Parametric Curves
Designing Curves • We don't want only polygons. • Curves are used for design. Users require a simple set of controls to allow them to edit and design curves easily. • Curves should have in?nite resolution, so we can zoom in and still see a smooth curve. • We want to have a compact representation. Parametric functions are of the form x(t) = f(t) and y(t) = g(t) in two dimensions. This can be extended for arbitrary dimensions. They can be used to model curves that are not functions of any axis in the plane.
Curves can be de?ned as polynomials, for example x(t) = 5t10 + 4t9 + 3t8 + .... However, coef?cients are not intuitive editing parameters, and these curves are dif?cult to control. Hence, we will consider more intuitive parameterizations.
15.2 B´ezier curves
We can de?ne a set of curves called B´ezier curves by a procedure called the de Casteljau algorithm. Given a sequence of control points ¯ pk, de Casteljau evaluation provides a construction of smooth parametric curves. Evaluation proceeds by repeatedly de?ning new, smaller point sequences until we have a single point at the value for t for which we are evaluating the curve.

The curves ¯ p2 0 and ¯ p2 1 are quadratic B´ezier curves, each de?ned by three control points. For all B´ezier curves, we keep t in the range [0...1]
