Recent progress in acquiring shape from range data permits the acquisition
of seamless million-polygon meshes from physical models.
In this paper, we present an algorithm and system for converting
dense irregular polygon meshes of arbitrary topology into tensor
product B-spline surface patches with accompanying displacement
maps. This choice of representation yields a coarse but efficient
model suitable for animation and a fine but more expensive
model suitable for rendering.
The first step in our process consists of interactively painting
patch boundaries over a rendering of the mesh. In many applications,
interactive placement of patch boundaries is considered part
of the creative process and is not amenable to automation. The next
step is gridded resampling of each boundedsection of the mesh. Our
resampling algorithm lays a grid of springs across the polygon mesh,
then iterates between relaxing this grid and subdividing it. This grid
provides a parameterization for the mesh section, which is initially
unparameterized. Finally, we fit a tensor product B-spline surface to
the grid. We also output a displacement map for each mesh section,
which represents the error between our fitted surface and the spring
grid. These displacement maps are images; hence this representation
facilitates the use of image processing operators for manipulating
the geometric detail of an object. They are also compatible with
modern photo-realistic rendering systems.
Our resampling and fitting steps are fast enough to surface a million
polygon mesh in under 10 minutes - important for an interactive
system.

1 Introduction
Advances in range image acquisition and integration allow us to
compute geometrical models from complex physical models [9, 36].
The output of these technologies is a dense, seamless (i.e. manifold)
irregular polygon mesh of arbitrary topology. For example,
the model in figure 12, generated from 75 scans of an action figure
using a Cyberware laser range scanner, contains 350,000 polygons.
Models like this offer new opportunities to modelers and animators
in the CAD and entertainment industries.
Dense polygon meshes are an adequate representation for some
applications. Several commercial animation houses employ polygon
meshes almost exclusively. However, for reasons of compactness,
control, manufacturability, or appearance, many users prefer
smooth surface representations. To satisfy these users, techniques
are needed for fitting surfaces to dense meshes of arbitrary topology.
A notable property of these new acquisition techniques is their
ability to capture fine surface detail. Whatever fitting technique we
employ should strive to retain this fine detail. Surprisingly, a unified
surface representationmaynot be the best approach. First, the heavy
machinery of most smooth surface representations (for example Bsplines)
makes them an inefficient way to represent fine geometric
detail. Second and perhaps more important, although geometric detail
is useful at the rendering stage of an animation pipeline, it may
not be of interest to either the modeler or the animator. Moreover,
its presence may degrade the time or memory performance of the
modeling system. For these reasons, we believe it is advantageous
to separate the representations of coarse geometry and fine surface
detail.
Within this framework, we may choose from among many representations
for these two components. For representing coarse
geometry, modelers in the entertainment and CAD industry have
long used NURBS [14] and in particular uniform tensor product Bsplines.
Such models typically consist of control meshes stitched
together to the level of continuity desired for an application. In order
to address their needs we have chosen uniform tensor product
B-splines as our surface representation.
For representing surface detail, we propose using displacement
maps. Each pixel in such a map gives an offset from a point on
a fitted surface to a point on a gridded resampling of the original
polygon mesh. The principal advantageof this representation is that
displacement maps are essentially images. As such, they can be
processed, retouched, compressed, and otherwise manipulated using
simple image processing tools. Some of the effects shown in
figures 11 and 13 were achieved using Adobe Photoshop, a c
