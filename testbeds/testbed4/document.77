1 Geometry
Let no one enter who does not know geometry. Inscription on Plato's door,probably at the Academy ofAthens (c.429-347 BC).
This section contains formulas often required in computer graphics and is organised into 19 groups:
1.1 Lines,angles and trigonometry 1.2 Circles 1.3 Triangles 1.4 Quadrilaterals 1.5 Polygons 1.6 Three-dimensional objects 1.7 Coordinate systems 1.8 Vectors 1.9 Quaternions 1.10 Transformations 1.11 Two-dimensional straight lines 1.12 Lines and circles 1.13 Second degree curves 1.14 Three-dimensional straight lines 1.15 Planes 1.16 Lines,planes and spheres 1.17 Three-dimensional triangles 1.18 Parametric curves and patches 1.19 Second degree surfaces in standard form
Most of these formulas are developed in the section on Proofs and placed in context in the section on Examples.

Unde?ned results
The reader will probably be aware that the simplest of formulas must be treated with great care.For example x  a/bappears rather innocent,but is unde?ned when b  0. Similarly,s   t will only generate a real value when t  0.Therefore similar care must be exercised when using vectors and quaternions.For example,if a vector is accidentally set null,e.g.n  ai  bj  ckwhere a  b  c  0 then n•n 0.This in itself is not a problem,but if this dot product is in the denominator of a formula,then the result is unde?ned and will terminate a computer program unless this condition is detected prior to the division.
Determinants
Some formulas in this section are expressed in determinant form simply because they provide a neat and compact notation.However,a determinant can be zero,therefore its value must be determined if it is used as a denominator in a formula.
Vectors
Formulas involving vectors can often be simpli?ed if they are unit vectors.For example, the angle a between two vectors n1 and n2 is given by
but if ||n1||  ||n2||  1 a  cos1(n1 • n2) which saves unnecessary computation.
Matrices
Matrix transformations are another source of error when developing computer programs. Unfortunately,two systems are still in use and create untold havoc when a matrix is copied from a book or technical paper without knowing the source of the transform.For example, this text employs column vectors:
where xax  by ycx  dy

However,when using row vectors we have
where xax  cy ybx  dy which does not produce the same result! The second example can be made identical to the ?rst by transposing the matrix:
where xax  by ycx  dy which is what the reader will have to do if they discover such a matrix.For example,a rotation matrix using row vectors is
but when transposed creates the more familiar column vector form
Readers not familiar with matrices should appreciate that matrix multiplication is not commutative,i.e.in general TA  TB  TB  TA.This is easily seen using a simple example:
Given
then
whereas
It is obvious that they do not produce the same result.
Ef?ciency
The formulas listed in this section are not selected on the basis of speed.Such strategies are beyond the scope of this book and the reader should investigate how these formulas have been developed by authors and researchers to improve their ef?ciency.

1.1.1 Points and straight lines
The building blocks of Euclidian geometry are the pointand the straight line.A point indicates position in space and has no size or magnitude.A moving point describes a line, which has length but no width.From these two concepts evolve the following axioms:
1. Only one straight line can be drawn between two points. 2. Two straight lines intersect in one point only. 3. Two straight lines cannot enclose a space.
As soon as we introduce two or more lines,the idea of a plane surface emerges.Such a surface can be tested as follows: A straight line joining two points on a plane surface will also reside on that surface. From these simple de?nitions explode the subject of two-dimensional Euclidian geometry.
Parallel lines
Parallel lines remain a constant distance apart and reside on a common surface.
1.1.2 Angles
An angle is formed when two straight lines meet at a point.An angle is a spatial quantity and measures the rotational offset between the two lines when rotated about their common point or vertex.By de?nition,anti-clockwise angles are positive and clockwise angles are negative. Furthermore,by de?nition,one revolution equals 360°or 2p radians.
Acute,obtuse,right and straight angles
0°	acute angle	(right angle  90°)	obtuse angle	(straight angle  180°)

Peripheral angles subtended by a chord Peripheral angles subtended by a common chord are equal.
Secants
A secant of a circle is a straight line that intersects the circle's circumference in two points.
The secant theorem If two secants intersect at Ooutside a circle,then the product of the intercepts between Oand the circle on one is equal to the product of the two intercepts on the other.
The secant-tangent theorem If two secants intersect at Ooutside a circle,and one of them is tangent to the circle,then the length of the intercept on the tangent between Oand the point of contact is the geometric mean of the lengths of the intercepts of the other secant.
Arcs
The central angle subtended by an arc is twice the angle on the circle.
When the central angle is 180°the angle at the periphery is 90°;and the arc is half the circumference.
