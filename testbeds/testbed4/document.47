Each of them are either sub divided or at the end of the maximum level of resolution you have smaller sub images or region of interest which will only have the background color or single polygon case, surrounding, contained or intersecting, disjoint of course is background color. So if you look back again as I rewind this stage here this was the initial case, split into four parts, three quadrants are handled, one quadrant left, first quadrant split again into four parts you will again have three quadrants processed very comfortably, only one quadrant having two is split again into four parts and that is the final result which you will get after subdivisions. This is an example only with two polygons where we have to go for subdivisions up to three levels. I leave it as an exercise for you to alter these positions of these two triangles or even the shapes of these two triangles and position it in a graph paper at different positions and start splitting and exercising.
Take this as a home exercise where you interchange these positions of these two triangles or take two different triangles with two different shapes and start splitting if necessary. You can take a small pencil, scale and a paper and workout this problem yourself with two polygons, with two different shapes at two different positions. That is what you do in the area subdivision method.
But an important lesson to be learnt to here is that if you just carefully watch the figure again if you compare the original scenario at stage number one before any subdivision and the final result which you have got if you compare stage one and four you see at the maximum number of subdivision is occurring at situations where their adjacent polygons close by and that too your operating more at near the edges of the vertices of the polygons.
More the overlap more will be the number of vertices around a certain area of interest so you need more and more subdivisions. And the complexity of this algorithm in image space subdivision is a very difficult case. Of course the maximum number of subdivisions, if you have an image of resolutions by m pixels by n pixels n could be 1024, 640 by 480 or up to 1024 whatever the case may be. Of course the maximum level of decomposition which you can go is log in step that is of course the worst case. The case of course an average case can be computed but it is very difficult to compute because it all depends upon the number of triangles which you have or polygons which you have, the relative positions of those polygons, relative positions of those edges and vertices the more closer you have the edges and vertices of two different polygons closer together or overlapping more the more subdivisions you will have and there is where you need to spend more time.
(Refer Slide Time 14:13)
As you can see here when you compare stage one initial stage and stage four final stage the subdivision is somewhere around over here where there is more of protect overlap. In other places where there is a background or only one single polygon you need not subdivide. If you add a third polygon you can visualize that you need to have more subdivisions necessary in cases where the edges of that third polygon will be overlapping to nearby edges of the other two polygons. And you can almost visualize such a stage that you will go on subdividing more and more.
Of course you cannot go beyond the pixel resolution but if you have to go to that pixel resolution the complexity of subdivision and testing goes on more and higher and higher which you cannot avoid but you have to do and that is the main degree of complexity of the area subdivision method, the main bottle neck of computational time necessary is subdivision and testing and more number of polygons overlapping their edges and vertices coming closer together will cause more subdivisions.
I will just give you a final example based on which you can visualize that if you look in this particular case just two triangles again completely overlapping as much as possible. As you can see here this is the final result of subdivision. So where do you find subdivisions getting more? It is at those edges which are overlapping those areas and the vertices which are overlapping certain areas. So, as long as the two triangles or polygons would have been separated out the number of subdivisions would have been but it would have been less. But the more closure you get more overlap you make more vertices and edges overlapping and then coming closer the more the subdivision necessary.
If you look at this particular figure you can visualize that the first edge is of course four quadrants and the simplest case out of these four sub quadrants which you will get first level of sub quadrants sub images is the third one. The third one is the only case where you have one intersecting polygon. I think it is clear, the sub quadrant is the only one third where you have no other polygons but just one intersecting polygon easily paint with the background color and then that part of the polygon which is overlapping and that part which is the third one is done.
First, second and fourth polygons have to sub divided. If you examine the second one that is also little better in the sense that you subdivide further into four parts this part is the background as pointed by an arrow here and then you have this part which is intersecting single intersection, here also you have a single intersection which is only in this sub quadrant one out of the second one where you have to divide into four parts because a small part of this polygon here and another polygon there which is getting into the picture.
That
