The results described above lead to the conclusion that we cannot describe all colors as positive linear combinations
of three primary colors. So, the commission came up with a standard for describing colors. They defined
three special super-saturated primary colors X, Y , and Z, which do not correspond to any real colors, but they
have the property that every real color can be represented as a positive linear combination of these three.
The resulting 3-dimensional space, and hence is hard to visualize. A common way of drawing the diagram is
to consider a single 2-dimensional slice, by normalize by cutting with
An interesting consequence is that, since the colors generated by your monitor are linear combinations of three
different colored phosphors, there exist regions of the CIE color space that your monitor cannot produce. (To
see this, find a bright orange sheet of paper, and try to imitate the same saturated color on your monitor.)
The CIE model is useful for providing formal specifications of any color as a 3-element vector. Carefully designed
image formats, such as TIFF and PNG, specify colors in terms of the CIE model, so that, in theory, two
different devices can perform the necessary corrections to display the colors as true as possible. Typical hardware
devices like CRT’s, televisions, and printers use other standards that are more convenient for generation
purposes. Unfortunately, neither CIE nor these models is particularly intuitive from a user’s perspective.
