To overcome this limitation, instead of individual
planar polygons, convex solid occluders were used,
such as boxes and cylinders as visibility blocking
proxies for large isolated structures. For the moment,
solid occluders are manually defined (modeled). A
convex solid, when projected on an arbitrary plane, is
guaranteed to produce a convex polygon. The convex
frustum of the projected polygon is the union of the
frusta that would be generated from the individual
planes of the faces of the solid occluder, thus
bypassing the need to merge frusta in order to avoid
partial occlusion.
Solid occluders are easy and efficient to define in
open space environments and therefore the method is
most suitable for such scenes. In enclosed (indoor)
static environments, although the application of the
method is equally feasible, it does not provide any
gain when compared with the simpler cell-and-portal
occlusion culling schema. Shadow frustum culling
using solid occluders is inherently compatible with
moving geometry as the solid blockers can be
transformed in space in the same manner as the rest
of the geometry, without any computational
overhead.
For each frame, the solid occluder frustum is
generated as follows (Fig. 3). The view-dependent
silhouette of the solid occluder is extracted by
determining the edges belonging to adjacent
polygons, which are not both visible or hidden
simultaneously:

( , )
( ) ( ) 0

i i j j

? · - ? · ? · - ? = ?? ?? ?? ??
?? ?? (1)
where k N
??
is the normal vector of triangle k tr , k 0 P
the triangle’s first point and C the viewpoint.
The silhouette edges do not lie on the same plane in
general. Therefore, a cap (near plane) for the semiinfinite
frustum must be approximately constructed,
based on the relative position of the viewer and the
silhouette points. If the near plane is too close,
geometry that is contained in the convex hull of the
edge poly-line may be falsely eliminated. Similarly,
choosing a plane near the average of the silhouette
points can be a disastrous selection for elongated
solid occluders in the view direction for the same
reason (Fig. 4). Therefore, the near plane of the
frustum is chosen so that it passes through the furthest
point of the silhouette line relative to the viewer. The
normal vector of the near frustum cap is the average
directional vector between each silhouette point and
the viewpoint C :

where i S is the i-th point out of the K silhouette
vertices.
The effectiveness of the solid occluders becomes
apparent when the viewpoint is moving among
buildings or other isolated obstacles at inspection
distance (near). Planar occluders would mostly
produce partial occlusion when the viewer is not
facing the main sides of the geometry straight on.
Most of the time, we view structures and moving
objects from odd angles and this is where the solid
occluders technique provides a unified and
contiguous frustum to take into account all planar
sides at once.

determination to (convex) frustum generation.

furthest silhouette point to the camera position.
3. OCCLUDER SELECTION
As explained by Hudson et al. [Hud97a], a scene may
contain too many occluders for a real-time
application to be able to test each object against each
one of them. For instance, in a finished virtual reality
production, such as the “Walk through Ancient
Olympia” by the Foundation of the Hellenic World
(FHW) [Gai04a], a virtual world may contain more
than 200 occluder planes and solids. Therefore, an
optimal set of occluders has to be selected for each
frame at run-time in order to keep the number of
“active” occluder primitives to a minimum. For this
task, a ranking function planar f and solid f has to be
devised for each type of blocking primitives that
takes into account the solid angle of the frustum. For
planar occluders, Hudson et al. use the area-angle
approximation presented by Coorg and Teller
[Coo97a]:
planar 2
f AN V
V
= - ·
?? ??
?? (3)
where A is the area of a planar occluder, N
??
is its
normal vector and V
??
is the vector from the
viewpoint to the center of the occluder. The criterion
of eq. (3) provides a reliable measure of occluder
importance. For solid occluders we use an
approximation formula, which depends on the
projection on the view plane of the solid occluder’s
volume Vol and the squared distance of the occluder
from the viewpoint:
2
solid 3
f Vol V Vol
V V
-
= · =
??
?? ?? (4)
Note that the above ranking function for the solid
occluders does not depend on angular attributes as
the near plane of the constructed frustum always
faces the center of projection (see eq. (2)). planar f and
solid f are balanced and do not need further biasing to
become compatible. At each frame cycle, an active
set of occluders, consisting of both solid and planar
ones, is determined by evaluating and sorting the
result of the corresponding ranking function for each
one of them. Please note that due to time coherence
and the fact that the occluder selection is not critical
for the visual quality, it is not necessary to perform
this sorting task at every frame. A typical size for the
active occluders set is 10 – 20 occluders, depending
on the field of view. For instance, our framework,
running on a four-wall surround-screen platform, uses
a set of 15 active occluders.
