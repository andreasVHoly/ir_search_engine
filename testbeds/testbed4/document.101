3D Objects
5.1 Surface Representations
As with 2D objects, we can represent 3D objects in parametric and implicit forms. (There are also explicit forms for 3D surfaces - sometimes called "height ?elds" - but we will not cover them here).
5.2 Planes • Implicit: (¯ p- ¯ p0)·~n = 0, where ¯ p0 is a point in R3 on the plane, and ~n is a normal vector perpendicular to the plane.
n
p 0
A plane can be de?ned uniquely by three non-colinear points ¯ p1, ¯ p2, ¯ p3. Let~a = ¯ p2-¯ p1 and ~ b = ¯ p3 - ¯ p1, so ~a and~ b are vectors in the plane. Then ~n = ~a×~ b. Since the points are not colinear,k~nk6= 0.
• Parametric: ¯ s(a,ß) = ¯ p0 + a~a + ß~ b, for a,ß ? R. Note: This is similar to the parametric form of a line: ¯ l(a) = ¯ p0 + a~a.
A planar patch is a parallelogram de?ned by bounds on a and ß.
Example: Let 0 = a = 1 and 0 = ß = 1:
a
bp 0

5.3 Surface Tangents and Normals
The tangent to a curve at ¯ p is the instantaneous direction of the curve at ¯ p.
The tangent plane to a surface at ¯ p is analogous. It is de?ned as the plane containing tangent vectors to all curves on the surface that go through ¯ p.
A surface normal at a point ¯ p is a vector perpendicular to a tangent plane.
5.3.1 Curves on Surfaces
The parametric form ¯ p(a,ß) of a surface de?nes a mapping from 2D points to 3D points: every 2D point (a,ß) in R2 corresponds to a 3D point ¯ p in R3. Moreover, consider a curve ¯ l(?) = (a(?),ß(?)) in 2D - there is a corresponding curve in 3D contained within the surface: ¯ l*(?) = ¯ p(¯ l(?)).
5.3.2 Parametric Form
For a curve ¯ c(?) = (x(?),y(?),z(?))T in 3D, the tangent is
d¯ c(?) d?
=dx(?) d?
,
dy(?) d?
,
dz(?) d? . (10)
For a surface point ¯ s(a,ß), two tangent vectors can be computed:
?¯ s ?a
and
?¯ s ?ß
. (11)
Derivation: Consider a point (a0,ß0) in 2D which corresponds to a 3D point ¯ s(a0,ß0). De?ne two straight lines in 2D:
¯ d(?1) = (?1,ß0)T (12) ¯ e(?2) = (a0,?2)T (13)
These lines correspond to curves in 3D:
¯ d*(?1) = ¯ s(¯ d(?1)) (14) ¯ e*(?2) = ¯ s(¯ d(?2)) (15)

Using the chain rule for vector functions, the tangents of these curves are:
? ¯ d* ??1
=
?¯ s ?a
? ¯ da ??1
+
?¯ s ?ß
? ¯ dß ??1
=
?¯ s ?a
(16)
?¯ e* ??2
=
?¯ s ?a
?¯ ea ??2
+
?¯ s ?ß
?¯ eß ??2
=
?¯ s ?ß
(17)
The normal of ¯ s at a = a0, ß = ß0 is ~n(a0,ß0) = ?¯ s ?a
 
 
 
a0,ß0
!× ?¯ s ?ß
 
 
 
a0,ß0
!. (18)
The tangent plane is a plane containing the surface at ¯ s(a0,ß0) with normal vector equal to the surface normal. The equation for the tangent plane is: ~n(a0,ß0)·(¯ p-¯ s(a0,ß0)) = 0. (19) What if we used different curves in 2D to de?ne the tangent plane? It can be shown that we get the same tangent plane; in other words, tangent vectors of all 2D curves through a given surface point are contained within a single tangent plane. (Try this as an exercise).
Note: The normal vector is not unique. If ~n is a normal vector, then any vector a~n is also normal to the surface, for a ? R. What this means is that the normal can be scaled, and the direction can be reversed.
5.3.3 Implicit Form
In the implicit form, a surface is de?ned as the set of points ¯ p that satisfy f(¯ p) = 0 for some function f. A normal is given by the gradient of f,
~n(¯ p) = ?f(¯ p)|¯ p (20)
where?f =?f(¯ p) ?x , ?f(¯ p) ?y , ?f(¯ p) ?z . Derivation: Consider a 3D curve ¯ c(?) that is contained within the 3D surface, and that passes through ¯ p0 at ?0. In other words, ¯ c(?0) = ¯ p0 and
f(¯ c(?)) = 0 (21)

for all ?. Differentiating both sides gives:
?f ??
= 0 (22)
Expanding the left-hand side, we see:
?f ??
=
?f ?x
?¯ cx ??
+
?f ?y
?¯ cy ??
+
?f ?z
?¯ cz ??
(23)
= ?f(¯ p)|¯ p ·
d¯ c d?
= 0 (24)
This last line states that the gradient is perpendicular to the curve tangent, which is the de?nition of the normal vector.
Example: The implicit form of a sphere is: f(¯ p) = k¯ p-¯ ck2 -R2 = 0. The normal at a point¯ p is: ?f = 2(¯ p-¯ c).
Exercise: show that the normal computed for a plane is the same, regardless of whether it is computed using the parametric or implicit forms. (This was done in class). Try it for another surface.
