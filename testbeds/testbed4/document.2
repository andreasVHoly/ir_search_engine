Elements of Pictures: Computer graphics is all about producing pictures (realistic or stylistic) by computer. Before
discussing how to do this, let us first consider the elements that make up images and the devices that produce
them. How are graphical images represented? There are four basic types that make up virtually of computer
generated pictures: polylines, filled regions, text, and raster images.
Polylines: A polyline (or more properly a polygonal curve is a finite sequence of line segments joined end to
end. These line segments are called edges, and the endpoints of the line segments are called vertices. A
single line segment is a special case. (An infinite line, which stretches to infinity on both sides, is not
usually considered to be a polyline.) A polyline is closed if it ends where it starts. It is simple if it does not
self-intersect. Self-intersections include such things as two edge crossing one another, a vertex intersecting
in the interior of an edge, or more than two edges sharing a common vertex. A simple, closed polyline is
also called a simple polygon. If all its internal angle are at most 180_, then it is a convex polygon.
A polyline in the plane can be represented simply as a sequence of the (x; y) coordinates of its vertices.
This is sufficient to encode the geometry of a polyline. In contrast, the way in which the polyline is
rendered is determined by a set of properties call graphical attributes. These include elements such as
color, line width, and line style (solid, dotted, dashed), how consecutive segments are joined (rounded,
mitered or beveled; see the book for further explanation).

Many graphics systems support common special cases of curves such as circles, ellipses, circular arcs, and
Bezier and B-splines. We should probably include curves as a generalization of polylines. Most graphics
drawing systems implement curves by breaking them up into a large number of very small polylines, so
this distinction is not very important.
Filled regions: Any simple, closed polyline in the plane defines a region consisting of an inside and outside.
(This is a typical example of an utterly obvious fact from topology that is notoriously hard to prove. It is
called the Jordan curve theorem.) We can fill any such region with a color or repeating pattern. In some
instances the bounding polyline itself is also drawn and others the polyline is not drawn.

A polyline with embedded “holes” also naturally defines a region that can be filled. In fact this can be
generalized by nesting holes within holes (alternating color with the background color). Even if a polyline
is not simple, it is possible to generalize the notion of interior. Given any point, shoot a ray to infinity. If it
crosses the boundary an odd number of times it is colored. If it crosses an even number of times, then it is
given the background color.

Text: Although we do not normally think of text as a graphical output, it occurs frequently within graphical
images such as engineering diagrams. Text can be thought of as a sequence of characters in some font. As
with polylines there are numerous attributes which affect how the text appears. This includes the font’s
face (Times-Roman, Helvetica, Courier, for example), its weight (normal, bold, light), its style or slant
(normal, italic, oblique, for example), its size, which is usually measured in points, a printer’s unit of
measure equal to 1=72-inch), and its color.

Raster Images: Raster images are what most of us think of when we think of a computer generated image.
Such an image is a 2-dimensional array of square (or generally rectangular) cells called pixels (short for
“picture elements”). Such images are sometimes called pixel maps.
The simplest example is an image made up of black and white pixels, each represented by a single bit (0
for black and 1 for white). This is called a bitmap. For gray-scale (or monochrome) raster images raster
images, each pixel is represented by assigning it a numerical value over some range (e.g., from 0 to 255,
ranging from black to white). There are many possible ways of encoding color images. We will discuss
these further below.
Graphics Devices: The standard interactive graphics device today is called a raster display. As with a television, the
display consists of a two-dimensional array of pixels. There are two common types of raster displays.
Video displays: consist of a screen with a phosphor coating, that allows each pixel to be illuminated momentarily
when struck by an electron beam. A pixel is either illuminated (white) or not (black). The level of
intensity can be varied to achieve arbitrary gray values. Because the phosphor only holds its color briefly,
the image is repeatedly rescanned, at a rate of at least 30 times per second.
Liquid crystal displays (LCD’s): use an electronic field to alter polarization of crystalline molecules in each
pixel. The light shining through the pixel is already polarized in some direction. By changing the polarization
of the pixel, it is possible to vary the amount of light which shines through, thus controlling its
intensity.
