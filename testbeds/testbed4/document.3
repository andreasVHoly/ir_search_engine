The method chosen for representing color depends on the characteristics of the graphics output device (e.g.,
whether it is additive as are video displays or subtractive as are printers). It also depends on the number of bits
per pixel that are provided, called the pixel depth. For example, the most method used currently in video and
color LCD displays is a 24-bit RGB representation. Each pixel is represented as a mixture of red, green and
blue components, and each of these three colors is represented as a 8-bit quantity (0 for black and 255 for the
brightest color).
In many graphics systems it is common to add a fourth component, sometimes called alpha, denoted A. This
component is used to achieve various special effects, most commonly in describing how opaque a color is. We
will discuss its use later in the semester. For now we will ignore it.
In some instances 24-bits may be unacceptably large. For example, when downloading images from the web,
24-bits of information for each pixel may be more than what is needed. A common alternative is to used a color
map, also called a color look-up-table (LUT). (This is the method used in most gif files, for example.) In a
typical instance, each pixel is represented by an 8-bit quantity in the range from 0 to 255. This number is an
index to a 256-element array, each of whose entries is a 234-bit RGB value. To represent the image, we store
both the LUT and the image itself. The 256 different colors are usually chosen so as to produce the best possible
reproduction of the image. For example, if the image is mostly blue and red, the LUT will contain many more
blue and red shades than others.
A typical photorealistic image contains many more than 256 colors. This can be overcome by a fair amount
of clever trickery to fool the eye into seeing many shades of colors where only a small number of distinct
colors exist. This process is called digital halftoning, as shown in Fig. 8. Colors are approximated by putting
combinations of similar colors in the same area. The human eye averages them out.
