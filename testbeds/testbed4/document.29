
Intense introduction to image processing.
•Intended for advanced undergraduate and graduate students.
Topics include:
-Image enhancement
-Digital filtering theory, Fourier transforms
-Image reconstruction, resampling, antialiasing
-Scanline algorithms, geometric transforms
-Warping, morphing, and visual effects

Image processing is a subclass of signal processing concerned specifically with pictures

•It aims to improve image quality for
-human perception: subjective
-computer interpretation: objective

•Compress images for efficient storage/transmission

We observe and evaluate images with our visual system
•We must therefore understand the functioning of the human visual system and its capabilities for brightness adaptation and discrimination:
-What intensity differences can we distinguish?
-What is the spatial resolution of our eye?
-How accurately do we estimate distances and areas?
-How do we sense colors?
-By which features can we detect/distinguish objects

Images can be classified by whether they are defined over all points in the spatial domain and whether their image values have finite or infinite precision.
•If the position variables (x,y) are continuous, then the function is defined over all points in the spatial domain.
•If (x,y) is discrete, then the function can be sampled at only a finite set of points, i.e., the set of integers.
•The value that the function returns can also be classified by its precision, independently of x and 

Point operations are used to enhance an image. 
•Processed image should be more suitable than the original image for a specific application.
•Suitability is application-dependent.
•A method which is quite useful for enhancing one image may not necessarily be the best approach for enhancing another image.
•Very subjective
