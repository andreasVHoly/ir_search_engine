Assume that angles are measured in degrees. The translation will then apply to all subsequent drawing. But, because of the rotation command, the things that you draw after the translation are rotated objects. That is, the translation applies to objects that havealready been rotated. An example is shown on the left in the illustration below, where the light gray "F" is the original shape, and red "F" shows the result of applying the two transforms to the original. The original "F" was first rotated through a 90 degree angle, and then moved 4 units to the right.
 
Note that transforms are applied to objects in the reverse of the order in which they are given in the code (because the first transform in the code is applied to an object that has already been affected by the second transform). And note that the order in which the transforms are applied is important. If we reverse the order in which the two transforms are applied in this example, by saying
rotate(90)
translate(4,0)
then the result is as shown on the right in the above illustration. In that picture, the original "F" is first moved 4 units to the right and the resulting shape is then rotated through an angle of 90 degrees about the origin to give the shape that actually appears on the screen.
For another example of applying several transformations, suppose that we want to rotate a shape through an angle r about a point (p,q) instead of about the point (0,0). We can do this by first moving the point (p,q) to the origin, using translate(-p,-q). Then we can do a standard rotation about the origin by calling rotate(r). Finally, we can move the origin back to the point (p,q) by applyingtranslate(p,q). Keeping in mind that we have to write the code for the transformations in the reverse order, we need to say
translate(p,q)
rotate(r)
translate(-p,-q)
before drawing the shape. (In fact, some graphics APIs let us accomplish this transform with a single command such as rotate(r,p,q). This would apply a rotation through the angle r about the point (p,q).)
