Single HD PTZ Camera - Joystick control over the Camera 
 
 
 
 
A professional, remote controlled, single HD camera system, allowing smooth pans, tilts and zooms to follow moving people on the platform. Can be recorded or projected or both. The joystick camera controller combo provides 12 preset shots per camera and fine camera adjustments. Record the camera feed with your computer. Plus you'll have an available 
HD connection to send the signal (image from the camera) where you want in your building (to a projection system, 
overflow room, cry room, etc). You'll be using your computer monitor to observe the image the camera is sending. If you want the ability to mix and layer computer graphics, you need to step up to the HD Mix Master package.

This system uses cheap and easy to get CAT5 cable to not only send the video signal and camera control back and forth from the control booth to the camera, but they also send the power to the camera via the CAT5! This is a huge time and money saver because you do not have to have an electrician put a power outlet next to each camera location. The Vaddio cameras (based on Sony models) provide excellent clarity and color and with their ability to be remotely controlled and powered via CAT5 cable, you have a natural choice for a system that is easy to install and even easier to use. 
 
 
JOYSTICK CAMERA CONTROL 
This system utilizes a joystick camera control unit from Vaddio that allows you to precisely control how the camera moves and where it is positioned. The joystick controller provides up to 12 camera presets for each camera. You can pre- program the tight shot of the pulpit, the wide shot of the altar area or the entire chancel. You can set up a close-up of the musicians and the baptistery. When you want a new shot, simply click the preset button and the camera instantly pans, tilts and zooms to the new location you just set. Be careful though, this system only features a single camera and

sometimes the speed of the camera moves between presets are too fast for live use. You may find yourself using the fine control of the joystick more often with a single camera system than with a multiple camera system. 
 
 
IMAGE MONITOR 
You'll be connecting your own computer to this system to record the video stream. You will use the image on your 
computer's screen to monitor what the camera is seeing and where it is pointing.	 
 
 
AV RECORDING AND STREAMING 
A common question we get is "what about recording or streaming?". This package provides you with Vaddio's professional AV Bridge unit that combines the audio signal from your mixing board and video from the camera system signal onto a USB cable. You can connect the USB cable to your computer (not include in the package) and choose the software of your choice to record the video and/or stream it out to the internet. Any computer will recognize your incoming AV stream as a webcam type device. There are so many flavors of computers, software packages and streaming packages that it is beyond the scope of CMM to provide or support the choices. What works for you may be a disaster for the church down the road.. 
 
 
NOTES 
IMPORTANT note about the recording and streaming: You have to add the audio from your sound system. The cameras don't have microphones. You MUST supply audio from your own existing audio board and the cables to connect the audio from your board to the Vaddio AV Bridge. Since every system is different, you must supply the cables. It's not difficult, you can supply your audio signal on either XLR or RCA cables to the Vaddio AV Bridge. Each camera system will have the required video cable to connect the video signal to the Vaddio AV Bridge. 
 
 
CAT5 Cable NOT provided: Since each church building and distance varies so much and CAT5 cable is so easy to get locally, it is up to you to purchase enough CAT5 cable and connectors to complete your setup.

Notes about installation:	 With the purchase of each CMM package that has two or more cameras, a table top rack is 
supplied with screws and adaptors as needed to professionally mount and install the equipment. All of these packages require A LOT of assembly. You will be provided a detailed connection diagram for your specific package that shows how each component in your system connects to the others including a recommended rack layout. 
 
 
The connection diagram will show you which pieces of equipment connect together. However it is expected that you will first read the installation instructions that come with the Vaddio cameras and controller. 
 
 
But you will have to be comfortable with and familiar with cabling techniques to successfully install, connect and assemble the system. You will need to be comfortable and familiar with installing (pulling) and terminating (putting the ends on) CAT5 cable. You will need to be ok routing CAT5 cable down walls and cutting drywall or plaster to pass the CAT5 cables through to the camera mount, etc. You'll need to be comfortable following the connection diagrams and managing a lot of cable in confined spaces. (An ample supply of cable ties and adhesive-backed velcro is recommended to have on hand during installation.) 
 
 
It is the responsibility of the customer to follow all local codes and building ordinances that might be involved when installing a system.
