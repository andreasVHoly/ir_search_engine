PERCEPTRON)â€”A REVIEW OF APPLICATIONS IN THE
ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES

1. INTRODUCTION
Neural networks, or more precisely artificial neural
networks, are a branch of artificial intelligence. Multilayer
perceptrons form one type of neural network as
illustrated in the taxonomy in Fig. 1. This article only
considers the multilayer perceptron since a growing
number of articles are appearing in the atmospheric
literature that cite its use. Many of these papers describe
the benefits that neural networks offer when
compared to more traditional statistical modelling
techniques. Most of the papers briefly describe the
workings of neural networks and provide references,
to books and papers, from which the reader may
obtain further information. This review is aimed at
readers with little or no understanding of neural networks
and is designed to act as a guide through the
literature so that they may better appreciate this tool.
This review is divided into several sections, beginning
with a brief introduction to the multilayer perceptron
followed by a description of the most basic
algorithm for training a multilayer perceptron, known
as backpropagation. A review of some of the recent
applications of the multilayer perceptron to atmospheric
problems will be presented followed by a discussion
of some of the common practical problems and
limitations associated with a neural network approach. most suitable approach depends on the complexity of
the problem being addressed and the degree to which
the problem is understood. Assuming adequate data
and computing resources and if a strong theoretical
understanding of the problem is available then a full
numerical model is perhaps the most desirable solution.
However, in general, as the complexity of a problem
increases the theoretical understanding decreases
(due to ill-defined interactions between systems) and
statistical approaches are required. Recently, the use
of neural networks, and in particular the multilayer
perceptron, have been shown to be effective alternatives
to more traditional statistical techniques
(Schalkoff, 1992). Primarily it has been shown
(Hornik et al., 1989) that the multilayer perceptron
can be trained to approximate virtually any smooth,
measurable function. Unlike other statistical techniques
the multilayer perceptron makes no prior assumptions
concerning the data distribution. It can
model highly non-linear functions and can be trained
to accurately generalise when presented with new,
unseen data. These features of the multilayer perceptron
make it an attractive alternative to developing
numerical models, and also when choosing between
statistical approaches. As will be seen the multilayer
perceptron has many applications in the atmospheric
sciences.

7. CONCLUSION
The multilayer perceptron has been shown to be
a useful tool for prediction, function approximation
and classification. The practical benefits of a modelling
system that can accurately reproduce any
measurable relationship is huge. The benefits of the
multilayer perceptron approach are particularly apparent
in applications where a full theoretical model
cannot be constructed, and especially when dealing
with non-linear systems. The numerous difficulties in
implementing, training and interpreting the multilayer
perceptron must be balanced against the performance
benefits when compared to more traditional,
and often inappropriate, techniques.
There are many commercially and freely available
software packages that enable users to implement
neural networks relatively easily (Sarle, 1997). Such
software is increasingly allowing neural networks to
be implemented in a similar manner to regression or
discriminant analysis, shielding the user from difficult
parameter selection. Unfortunately, most packages
provide only a limited number of training algorithms,
which cannot be adjusted or adapted by the user.
