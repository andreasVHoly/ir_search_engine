Human–computer interaction research is inevitably forward-looking because of the extraordinary pace of improvements in the technology and the expectations that this generates. We know that we will be able to do tomorrow what we barely dreamed of yesterday, and that successful innovations will be assimilated rapidly into the texture of our society to become part of our everyday routines and expectations. Our focus is to transform possibilities in our worlds of speculation from abstractions to effective technologies assimilated in, and enhancing, our lifeworlds. Occasionally, however, it is useful to look back, assess how far we have come, recognize how much was unexpected, and use this to refine our projections, noting that the future is amazingly open. We need to be able to recognize and utilize what we did not expect as much as we also need to strive particular objectives by particular means. The uncertainties of the technologies and the openness of the future should not, however, blind us to the underlying human needs and intrinsic human capabilities that have remained constant for millennia. Our research serves a society where individuals, social groups, organizations, nations and civilizations attempt to survive and prosper. Their specific aspirations reflect the ethos of each era but their fundamental needs and unenhanced individual capacities have remained the same throughout recorded history. The accumulation of techniques for addressing these needs and enhancing these capabilities we term human ‘‘knowledge.’’ As a species we are ‘‘doomed to think in order to live’’ (Castan˜eda, 1990, p. 3). Knowledge acquisition and utilization to support our thinking has been a major imperative of human civilization throughout the millennia. In our era, computer technology and human– computer interaction have come to play a major role in knowledge processes, facilitating a level of knowledge generation, dissemination, access and utilization beyond that we have ever known. This journal has played a significant role in supporting the development of improved human–computer interaction technologies and has had strong engagement with research in such interaction at the knowledge level. In particular it has been a major forum for research on the support of human knowledge acquisition processes and as we celebrate 25 years of the knowledge acquisition conferences world-wide it is appropriate to reflect not only on the progress over that period but also on how that progress is situated in the growth of human knowledge over much longer time scales. This paper traces human knowledge acquisition processes, and techniques for their support, from time long past through time recent and time present to speculations on time future. The historian, White (1972), has emphasized the plasticity and metaphorical power of historical accounts—we construct histories for ourselves that both empower and constrain our futures. Setting the history of the knowledge community within the ethos of artificial intelligence and expert systems studies alone may not provide an appropriate framework for our current and future research in the much wider context of the semantic web and its role in human society. This paper and the others in this special issue present a number of perspectives on knowledge acquisition that enable us to construct histories for our community that empower and constrain our futures in interesting ways. Considering the choices available seems an appropriate agenda for our 25th anniversary. They are neither mutually exclusive nor exhaustive—just food for thought—what will be our themes, targets and agendas for the next 25 years? In general there is a continuing need to consolidate and extend all that we know of knowledge acquisition processes and techniques, drawing upon all literatures and disciplines to support our stewardship of the state-of-theart in knowledge acquisition. That includes the need to continue to enhance the tools we make available to take advantages of developments in knowledge representation and computer technologies. We also need to track user requirements for knowledge acquisition technologies to support both the needs of those applying them and the innovations in knowledge acquisition that may be outside of, or substantially extend, our current frameworks. In particular, the original logicist framework that has dominated artificial intelligence and expert systems research, may need substantial extension to support knowledge acquisition systems that incorporate the information indexing techniques of the web. Beyond all that we need to appreciate the foundational role of knowledge in the evolution of our species and civilizations, a role so fundamental to the essence of what we are that is subject to social dynamics on a scale that we do not yet fully comprehend. The utopian dream of those who saw universal access to knowledge as improving the human condition has to be balanced by the reality that powerful new resources like the Internet can be used by any sector of society to support their activities regardless of how society at large might evaluate them. The technology is neutral to its usage, supporting scientific collaboration (Olson et al., 2008) and discovery (Nielsen, 2012), political and special-interest groups (Ferdinand, 2000), the impoverished in under-developed countries (Burrell, 2012), and criminal activities (Jaishankar, 2011) without discrimination; that is what it means for a technology to become an integral part of our society. The future will continue to surprise us not only in the technologies we shall be using in another quarter century but also in the ways in which our fellow humans are using them to create a world that, perhaps, even the most speculative science fiction authors have not yet envisioned. We do live in very interesting times. May the knowledge acquisition research community live long and prosper.
