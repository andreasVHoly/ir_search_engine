Introduction
Climate change and its impacts on water resources have gained
significant attention in hydrology. General circulation models
(GCMs) provide reasonable simulations of weather variables at global
scales for climate change study, but cannot generate local climate
details for impact studies of water resources at a drainage
basin. Accordingly, downscaling methods have been developed to
link GCM outputs at coarse resolutions with surface weather variables
at finer resolutions. Downscaling methods are commonly
classified as statistical downscaling and dynamic downscaling. Statistical
downscaling methods construct a statistical relationship
between large-scale GCM outputs and local weather variables,
and dynamic downscaling methods employ high-resolution regional
climate models nested in a GCM to obtain local weather variables.
Although both statistical and dynamic downscaling
methods have their own advantages, statistical downscaling is
more widely adopted in hydrological studies because it is less computationally
demanding.
Statistical downscaling can be roughly grouped into four
categories, weather typing method (e.g., Bárdossy and Plate,
1992; von Storch et al., 1993; Bárdossy, 1997), stochastic weather generators (e.g., Selker and Haith, 1990; Tung and Haith, 1995; Yu
et al., 2002), resampling methods (e.g., Murphy, 2000; Buishand
and Brandsma, 2001; Palutikof et al., 2002) and regression methods.
A regression method constructs a linear or non-linear empirical
function between local-scale variables and large-scale GCM
variables, and is preferred among statistical downscaling methods
because it is easy to implement. The downscaling regression function
is derived by artificial neural networks (Hewitson and Crane,
1996; Olsson et al., 2001; Dibike and Coulibaly, 2006), canonical
correlation analysis (Kaas et al., 1996; Landman et al., 2001), principal
components (Burger, 1996; Menzel and Burger, 2002; Chu
et al., 2008) or support vector machines (Tripathi et al., 2006;
Anandhi et al., 2008).
Various downscaling models and software have been developed.
One popularly used model is the statistical downscaling
model (SDSM) (Wilby et al., 2002). For example, Wilby et al.
(2006) combined SDSM with a conceptual water balance model
and a mass-balance water quality model to investigate climate
change impact assessment and uncertainty in river flow and water
quality. Additionally, SDSM is often compared with statistical
downscaling models. Harpham and Wilby (2005) compared SDSM
with two artificial neural networks (ANNs), and concluded that
SDSM yields better daily precipitation quantiles and inter-site
correlation than the ANNs. Khan et al. (2006) compared SDSM, a
weather generator model and an ANN model to assess thuncertainty of downscaling results, and concluded that SDSM
reproduces the best statistical characteristics of observed data.
Research of climate change impacts on water resources often
requires downscaling daily precipitation. This study proposes a
two-step statistical downscaling method for daily precipitation
projection. The first step is to classify the day as dry or wet, and
the second is regression to calculate daily precipitation amount if
the day is classified as wet. The proposed statistical downscaling
method is based on two methodologies, namely support vector
machines (SVMs), including support vector classification (SVC)
and support vector regression (SVR), and multivariate analysis,
including discriminant analysis (for classification) and multiple
regression. These methodologies are described in detail in Section
‘‘Methodologies”. Section ‘‘Study Area and Data” describes the local
daily precipitation data and the large-scale predictors from reanalysis
and GCM data. Section ‘‘Results and Discussion” presents
downscaling model development and results by SVM and multivariate
model. Comparison is also made with the SDSM downscaling
results. Finally, projected daily precipitations in the study area
are presented.

Conclusions and future work
This work proposes a daily precipitation downscaling method
consisting of classification and regression. The proposed method
was developed using SVM and multivariate analysis, and was compared
with the SDSM. Downscaled results reveal that the SVM produced
more accurate daily precipitation than the SDSM and the
multivariate model. Downscaled daily precipitation by the SVM
presented comparable quantile precipitations to observations,
and showed good agreement with the extreme events. The SDSM
was reported to outperform other models in some works (e.g.,
Harpham and Wilby, 2005; Khan et al., 2006), but did not perform
very well for downscaling daily precipitation in this study area.
Although the SDSM performed better than other models in relation
to small daily precipitation, it underestimated the quantile
precipitations.
Daily precipitation was divided into two categories, dry-day and
wet-day. Regression was then applied on the wet-day class to obtain
the precipitation amount. Future study could categorize wet
days more finely, for example, by considering days of light, medium
and heavy rain, and then construct different regression models
for each class. This approach could improve estimation of precipitation
amount on wet days, and reduce the number of negative values
calculated by the regression model. Moreover, this work
adopted large-scale weather factors at only the nearest GCM data
grid to develop the downscaling model, and used A2 and B2 scenario
data projected by HadCM3. Future work should consider
large-scale weather factors from a region covering more grids in
order to select the predictors and then to construct the downscaling
model. Also, season separation accounting for the date of onset
and duration in each year (e.g., Tripathi et al., 2006; Anandhi et al.,
2008) can be adopted rather than the ‘‘hard” separation in wet and
dry season by the months. Furthermore, additional GCM models,
and their updated projection data, could be used to investigate
the possible change in future daily precipitation in the study area.
