BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE AND ANALYTICS:
FROM BIG DATA TO BIG IMPACT

Hsinchun Chen

Introduction
Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) and the related
field of big data analytics have become increasingly important
in both the academic and the business communities over the
past two decades. Industry studies have highlighted this
significant development. For example, based on a survey of
over 4,000 information technology (IT) professionals from 93
countries and 25 industries, the IBM Tech Trends Report
(2011) identified business analytics as one of the four major
technology trends in the 2010s. In a survey of the state of
business analytics by Bloomberg Businessweek (2011), 97 percent of companies with revenues exceeding $100 million
were found to use some form of business analytics. A report
by the McKinsey Global Institute (Manyika et al. 2011) predicted
that by 2018, the United States alone will face a shortage
of 140,000 to 190,000 people with deep analytical skills,
as well as a shortfall of 1.5 million data-savvy managers with
the know-how to analyze big data to make effective decisions.
Hal Varian, Chief Economist at Google and emeritus professor
at the University of California, Berkeley, commented on
the emerging opportunities for IT professionals and students
in data analysis as follows:

So whatâ€™s getting ubiquitous and cheap? Data. And
what is complementary to data? Analysis. So my
recommendation is to take lots of courses about how
to manipulate and analyze data: databases, machine
learning, econometrics, statistics, visualization, and
so on.1

The opportunities associated with data and analysis in different
organizations have helped generate significant interest
in BI&A, which is often referred to as the techniques, technologies,
systems, practices, methodologies, and applications
that analyze critical business data to help an enterprise better
understand its business and market and make timely business
decisions. In addition to the underlying data processing and
analytical technologies, BI&A includes business-centric
practices and methodologies that can be applied to various
high-impact applications such as e-commerce, market intelligence,
e-government, healthcare, and security.

This introduction to the MIS Quarterly Special Issue on
Business Intelligence Research provides an overview of this
exciting and high-impact field, highlighting its many challenges
and opportunities. Figure 1 shows the key sections
of this paper, including BI&A evolution, applications, and
emerging analytics research opportunities. We then report
on a bibliometric study of critical BI&A publications,
researchers, and research topics based on more than a decade
of related BI&A academic and industry publications. Education
and program development opportunities in BI&A are
presented, followed by a summary of the six articles that
appear in this special issue using our research framework.
The final section concludes the paper.
