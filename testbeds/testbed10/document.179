Imputation of missing data using machine learning techniques

Introduction
We have experimented with using various machine
learning techniques for completing industrial maintenanee
databases. These databases are usually (in
our experience, always) incomplete and contaminated
with erroneous data. Tools for completing partial data
based on past experience would be useful both as preprocessing
for further analysis and to provide assistance
to people performing data entry. We have experimented
with Autoclass, a Bayesian unsupervised
learning method and C4.5, a decision-tree based supervised
learning method. We describe our experiments,
describe the results and draw conclusions. Both offer
viable imputation and may be used in combination.
Structure of this paper
The organization of this paper is as follows. The first
section describes the magnitude of the missing dataproblem in the type of industrial data bases maintained
by Honeywell and its divisions. The next section introduces
the two machine learning techniques which we
have explored as potential data completion approaches,
and describes how they could be used for data completion.
The first of these two techniques, Autoclass, is
an unsupervised clustering strategy due to Cheeseman
et al. (1988) which uses a Bayesian approach to cluster
the data into classes. The classes so obtained are
then used to predict multiple choices for the attribute
of interest. The second technique involves modelling
missing variables by supervised induction of a decision
tree-based classifier, C4.5, due to Quinlan (1993). This
predicts the most likely value for the attribute of interest.
The next section then presents empirical results
from applying these two machine learning techniques
for predicting missing data. The last two sections discusse
potential applications of the procedures we are
developing, related work in statistics respectively. he Missing data problem
Like many businesses involved in the manufacture and
service of complex equipment, tIoneywell and its customers
compile vast amounts of maintenance data. For
a number of reasons, this data is plagued with errors
and lacunae. We discuss the type of data with which
we are working in this section.
Honeywell and its customers routinely compile maintenance
information for plant and building equipment
installed in various locations. Entry in these data bases
is carried out by field personnel, and for various reasons
is plagued by a high proportion of missing data
fields. In addition, the entered data is sometimes erroneous,
or is in a non-standard format and frequently
has spelling errors.
The magnitude of the problem for a typical industrial
process maintainence data base studied by one of
Honeywellâ€™s business units, Honeywell Loveland Controls,
is shown in Figure 1. This data base contains
maintainence information from process control devices.
Values for 82 variables or features are recorded in this
data base. Some of these variables are symbolic and
others are numeric. The variables measure properties of the devices such aa the manufacturer and model of
the device, aa well aa states of the devices at various
times such as calibration error, and paas/fail results of
testing. Of the 4383 records in this data base, none of
the records were complete and only 41 variables out of
82 have more than 50% of the records complete. This
level of incompleteness of the data base seriously limits
its usefulness to both analysts and field personnel.
