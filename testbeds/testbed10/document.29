A large body of functional neuroimaging literature has elucidated relationships between structure and function, as well as functional activity patterns during a variety of functional activation paradigms. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) (Friston et al., 1995) has played a fundamental role in these studies, by departing from the conventional biased ROI- and hypothesis-based methods of data analysis and enabling unbiased voxel-by-voxel examination of all brain regions. While a great deal of knowledge has been gained during the past decade regarding brain regions that are activated during various tasks using voxel-based SPM analysis, the quantitative characterization of entire spatio-temporal patterns of brain activity, as opposed to voxel by voxel examination, has received much less attention, especially as a means for deducing “the state of the mind” from functional imaging data. The important distinction between a voxel-based analysis and the analysis of a spatio-temporal pattern is the same as the distinction between (mass) uni-variate and multi-variate analysis (Davatzikos, 2004). Specifically, a pattern of brain activity is not only a collection of active voxels, but carries with it correlations among different voxels. Notable efforts towards the functional activity pattern analysishave been made (Strother et al., 1995 and McIntosh et al., 1996), some of which, attempt to use these methods to classify complex activation patterns using machine learningmethods (Cox and Savoy, 2003 and LaConte et al., 2005).
In this paper, we present an approach to the problem of identifying patterns of functional activity, by using a high-dimensional non-linear pattern classification method. We apply this approach to one of the long-standing challenges in applied psychophysiology, namely lie detection. Deception is a socially and legally important behavior. The limitations of the specificity of the currently available physiological methods of lie detection prompted the exploration of alternative methods based on the correlates of the central nervous system activity, such as EEG and fMRI (Rosenfeld, 2001, Spence et al., 2001 and Langleben et al., 2002). Using SPM-based analyses of multi-subject average group data, several recent fMRI studies demonstrated differences in brain activation between truthful and non-truthful responses in various experimental paradigms (Langleben et al., 2002, Langleben et al., in press, Ganis et al., 2003, Kozel et al., 2004a,Kozel et al., 2004b and Lee et al., 2002). In order to translate these data into a clinically relevant application, discrimination between lie and truth has to be achieved at the level of single participants and single trials (Kozel et al., 2004b), not just via group analysis. The potential of the SPM-based approach to achieve this goal is limited due to the between-subject variability of regional brain activity. In the current work, we have overcome this limitation using a multi-variate non-linear high-dimensionality pattern classification technique (Lao et al., 2004) applied to spatial patterns of brain activation recorded via fMRI. Using data acquired with a previously reported formal deception paradigm (Langleben et al., in press), we have tested the hypothesis that truthful and non-truthful responses could be distinguished via analysis of the pattern of functional brain activity. In addition to classifying a pattern of functional activity to the “truthful” and “non-truthful” categories, we construct spatial maps that display the brain regions that are most distinctive between these two response categories, by following the gradient direction of the decision function of the classifier, thereby allowing for visualization of the aspects of the functional activity patterns that are most different between the two conditions (lying and truth-telling).
Methods
Participants and deception task
Twenty-two right-handed male undergraduate students (M age = 19.36, SD = 0.5). After complete description of the study to the participants, written informed consent was obtained. The experimental procedure has been described in detail elsewhere (Langleben et al., in press).
A pseudorandom sequence of playing cards was composed of five stimulus classes: (1) Lie (5 of clubs or 7 of spades, participant's choice); (2) Truth (5 of clubs or 7 of spades); (3) Recurrent Distracter (2 hearts); (4) Varied distracter (remaining cards 2 through 10, all suits); and (5) Null (back of a card). Stimuli were presented for 2 s followed by a variable ISI (0–16 s) during which the null condition was displayed. Twenty-four Lie, Truth, and recurrent distracter cards and 168 variant distracter cards were shown. Participants were instructed to press a left button (yes) to confirm that a card was in their possession and the right button (no) to deny it. A total of 432 stimuli were presented with a total session length of 14.4 min.

Participants were presented an envelope containing 2 cards (5 clubs and 7 spades) and $20. One investigator (DDL) instructed participants to deny possession of one of the cards and acknowledge possession of the other in the imaging phase of the study. Participants were warned that the “fMRI investigator”, naïve to the true intent of the study, would give contradictory instructions. The assignment of “Lie” and “Truth” to the cards contained in the envelope, was left to the participants. Participants were told by DDL that they could keep the $20 only if successful in concealing identity of the lie card during the scan session. Participants were escorted to the scanner by a third party and instructed by the “fMRI investigator” (JWL) to respond to each trial as accurately and truthfully as possible. After the session, participants were debriefed, informed that the compensation was not contingent on performance, queried about the lie card, and asked if they employed any strategy during the task.
Image acquisition
Images were acquired using BOLD imaging (Bandettini et al., 1992) on a clinical 3 T Siemens Trio Scanner (Iselin, NJ). A 5 min magnetization-prepared, rapid acquisition gradient echo image (MPRAGE) was acquired for anatomic overlays of functional data and spatial normalization. BOLD imaging used a 33-slice whole-brain, single-shot gradient-echo (GE) echo-planar (EPI) sequence (TR/TE = 2000/21 ms, FOV = 240 mm, matrix = 64 × 64, slice thickness/gap = 4/0 mm). This sequence delivered a nominal voxel resolution of 3.75 × 3.75 × 4 mm.
Data analysis—parameter estimate images (PEIs)
Functional data were processed and analyzed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM2, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, London, UK). Data were slice-time corrected and motion-corrected to median image using b-spline interpolation (4 degrees of freedom). Co-registered images were normalized to standard anatomical space (T1 MNI template) using tri-linear interpolation (Ashburner and Friston, 1999) and smoothed with a Gaussian filter (full-width half maximum = 8 mm, isotropic). A high pass frequency filter (to a maximum of 1/100 Hz) and correction for autocorrelation {AR(1)} between scans were applied subsequently to the data. Initial statistical analysis was performed using the general linear model. The expected hemodynamic response was modeled by convolving stimuli onsets with a double gamma function as implemented in SPM2 (Friston et al., 1998). Forty-eight regressors modeled “lie” and “truth” events individually while two additional regressors modeled the variant distracter and recurrent distracter conditions. Parameter Estimate Images (PEIs), i.e. regression coefficients or “beta”, of the HRF regressor for each of the 50 conditions, were calculated from the least mean square fit of the model to the time series. The PEIs were used for the second stage analysis of non-linear pattern classification.
Non-linear pattern classification
To quantify the spatial patterns of brain activity that distinguish truthful from non-truthful responses, we first sampled brain activity uniformly throughout the entire brain, in a way that was unbiased by any a priori hypothesis of specific regions of interest. We then used these brain activity samples in conjunction with a pattern classification method to find patterns that allow us to distinguish between truthful and non-truthful responses. Our methodology is detailed next.
The bounding box of the linearly-registered PEIs was evenly subdivided into 560 cubes, each having a size of 16 mm × 16 mm × 16 mm. The average value of the PEI of each event was calculated within each of these boxes, thereby resulting in 560 measurements from each scan distributed uniformly throughout the entire brain. This collection of measurements constituted a sample of the spatial activation pattern. Customary to themachine learning terminology, we call these 560 values features. These features were subsequently normalized, so that they ranged from 0 to 1. Specifically, all PEIs of each individual, including truthful and non-truthful responses, were pooled together. The maximum and minimum values were determined and used to linearly rescale all PEIs of the respective individual between 0 and 1. This was repeated for all individuals separately. Feature normalization is an important procedure, since we are interested in examining relative levels of activation, i.e. activation patterns. Moreover, this scaling process is often used to reduce the total variance of the measurement across individuals, and thereby help make classes more separable.
These normalized measurements were then used as features into a non-linear support vector machine (SVM) with a Gaussian kernel (Lao et al., 2004, Vapnik, 1999 and Scholkopf and Smola, 2001). SVM is a powerful classification method that finds the hypersurface (high-dimensional analog to a surface separating two classes) that maximizes the margin between two distributions, the truthful and non-truthful responses in our case. One of the most important characteristics of SVM is that it is not calculated from all samples (activation patterns), but only from samples that lie close to the interface between the two groups of interest. In our case, the algorithm focuses only on activation patterns that are difficult to classify into truthful or non-truthful responses, since other patterns are easy to classify, anyway. A second important characteristic of SVM is that it can determine non-linear separating boundaries (hypersurfaces), by mapping the 560-dimensional feature vector into an infinite-dimensional space. Accordingly, complex and non-linear decision boundaries can be formed that separate the two conditions.
Using the aforementioned procedures, classifiers were constructed and tested using cross-validation. In each repetition of the cross-validation procedure, 1% of the PEIs were left out, and a classifier was constructed from the remaining 99% of the PEIs. This classifier was then tested on the left out 1%. This procedure was repeated 30 times, for randomly selected sets of left out PEIs. The cross-validation procedure is important, since SVM is a high-dimensional non-linear classifier (560 features) that was applied to a relatively small sample (24 “lie”, 24 “truth” for 22 participants, yielding 1056 training PEIs), suggesting that it is flexible enough to separate these two conditions. Therefore, how well a trained SVM “explains” the data may not be indicative of how well the same classifier will separate new sets of data.
