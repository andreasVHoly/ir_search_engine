Before performing the interpretability-accuracy analysis of fuzzy rule-based classifiers in detail, we demonstrate how our GBML algorithm works for the single-objective and multiobjective optimization problems through illustrative computational experiments on the diabetes data set. For illustration purpose, we randomly divided the 768 patterns of this data set into 384 training patterns and 384 test patterns. This setting of computational experiments is to easily show the error rates of each non-dominated fuzzy rule-based classifier on training patterns and test patterns. In the next subsection, we show experimental results based on the 10-fold cross-validation (10-CV) technique. Our GBML algorithm was applied to each of the six formulations (SOP-1 MOP-3) of fuzzy rule-based classifier design using the 384 training patterns of the diabetes data set. After 5000 generations in each trial, multiple non-dominated rule sets were obtained from each of the three multiobjective formulations. This is because our GBML algorithm was executed for each multiobjective formulation in the framework of evolutionary multiobjective optimization where a number of non-dominated solutions (i.e., non-dominated rule sets) were obtained as a result of optimization. On the other hand, a single rule set was obtained from each of the three single-objective formulations. This is because our GBML algorithm was executed for each single-objective formulation in the framework of evolutionary single-objective optimization where a single optimal solution (i.e., optimal rule set) with respect to the corresponding weighted sum scalar fitness function was obtained as a result of optimization. The obtained non-dominated rule sets from MOP-1 with f1(S) and f2(S) are shown in Fig. 2(a) together with the three rule sets obtained from the three single-objective formulations. The vertical axis of Fig. 2(a) is the error rate on the training patterns. In Fig. 2(a), the rejection of classification is counted as an error. Strictly speaking, the vertical axis is the sum of the error rate and the rejection rate. It should be noted that multiple non-dominated rule sets denoted by open circles in Fig. 2(a) were obtained by a single run of our GBML algorithm. This result clearly demonstrates that our multiobjective GBML algorithm can find a number of non-dominated rule sets by its single run. One of the obtained non-dominated rule sets from MOP-1 includes only a single fuzzy rule (i.e., f2(S) = 1), which is not shown in Fig. 2(a) because its error rate is out of the range of the vertical axis (i.e., 31.78% on the training patterns).
