Modern hospitals are well equipped with monitoring and other data collection devices which provide relatively inexpensive means to collect and store the data in inter- and intra-hospital information systems. Extensive amounts of data gathered in medical databases require specialized tools for storing and accessing data, for data analysis, and for effective use of data. In particular, the increase in data volume causes great difficulties in extracting useful information for decision support. Traditional manual data analysis has become inadequate, and methods for efficient computer-based analysis indispensable. To satisfy this need, medical informatics may use the technologies developed in the new interdisciplinary field of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) [16], encompassing statistical, pattern recognition, machine learning, and visualization tools to support the analysis of data and the discovery of regularities that are encoded within the data.

KDD typically consisting of the following steps [14] and [13]: understanding the domain, forming the dataset and cleaning the data, extracting regularities hidden in the data and formulating knowledge in the form of patterns or rules (this step in the overall KDD process is usually referred to as data mining (DM)), post-processing of discovered knowledge, and exploiting the results. This paper is only concerned with data mining, and presents some approaches to it which can be used to extract medical knowledge for diagnosis, screening, prognosis, monitoring, therapy support or overall patient management.

The results of computer-based analysis have to be communicated to people in an understandable way. In this respect, the analysis tools have to deliver transparent results and most often facilitate human intervention in the analysis process. A good example is a machine learning tool that, as a result of data analysis, aims to derive a symbolic model of high transparency and accuracy.

This paper presents selected data mining techniques that can be applied in medicine, and in particular those techniques that are well suited for the analysis of medical databases (derivation of symbolic rules, use of background knowledge, sensitivity and specificity of induced descriptions). Due to space limitations we omit the description of mechanisms for handling noise and missing data, as well as mechanisms for dealing with real valued and temporal data, which are also crucial for successful data mining in medicine. The importance of the interpretability of results of data analysis is discussed and illustrated on selected medical applications.

2. The nature of medical data
The well developed information infrastructure of modern hospitals provides relatively inexpensive means to store the data, which can become widely available via internet/intranet. The rapidly emerging globality of data requires standards in terminology, vocabularies and formats to support data sharing, standards for interfaces between different sources of data and integration of heterogeneous data (including images), and standards in the design of electronic patient records. Many environments still lack such standards, which hinders the use of data analysis tools on large global datasets, limiting their application to datasets collected for specific diagnostic, screening, prognostic, monitoring, therapy support or other patient management purposes.

Patient records collected for diagnosis and prognosis typically encompass values of anamnestic, clinical and laboratory parameters, as well as results of particular investigations, specific to the given task. Such datasets are characterized by their incompleteness (missing parameter values), incorrectness (systematic or random noise in the data), sparseness (few and/or non-representable patient records available), and inexactness (inappropriate selection of parameters for the given task). The development of machine learning tools for medical diagnosis and prediction was frequently motivated by the requirements for dealing with these characteristics of medical datasets [3] and [5].

Datasets collected in monitoring (either acute monitoring of a particular patient in an intensive care unit, or discrete monitoring over long periods of time in the case of patients with chronic diseases) have additional characteristics: they involve the measurements of a set of parameters at different times, requesting the temporal component to be taken into account in data analysis. These data characteristics need to be considered in the design of analysis tools for prediction, intelligent alarming and therapy support.

3. Selected data mining techniques
Current trends in medical decision making show awareness of the need to introduce formal reasoning, as well as intelligent data analysis techniques in the extraction of knowledge, regularities, trends and representative cases from patient data stored in medical records. Formal techniques include decision theory [17] and symbolic reasoning technology [35], as well as methods at their intersection, such as probabilistic belief networks [44]. Intelligent data analysis techniques include machine learning, clustering, data visualization, and interpretation of time-ordered data (derivation and revision of temporal trends and other forms of temporal data abstraction).

This paper is concerned with data mining methods for intelligent data analysis in medicine [33], in particular machine learning methods [36]. Machine learning methods can be classified into three major groups [36]: inductive learning of symbolic rules (such as induction of rules [7], decision trees [47] and logic programs [31]), statistical or pattern-recognition methods (such as k-nearest neighbors or instance-based learning [9] and [1], discriminate analysis and Bayesian classifiers), and artificial neural networks [51] (such as networks with back-propagation learning, Kohonen’s self-organizing network and Hopfield’s associative memory).

Machine learning methods have been applied to a variety of medical domains in order to improve medical decision making [26]. These include diagnostic and prognostic problems in oncology [3], liver pathology [34], neuropsychology [39], and gynaecology [43]. Improved medical diagnosis and prognosis may be achieved through automatic analysis of patient data stored in medical records, i.e. by learning from past experiences.

Given patient records with corresponding diagnoses, machine learning methods are able to diagnose new cases. More specifically, suppose E is a set of examples with known classifications. An example is described by the values of a fixed collection of features (attributes): Ai, i∈{1,..., Nat}. Each attribute can either have a finite set of values (discrete) or take real numbers as values (continuous). An individual example ej, j∈{1,..., Nex} is a n-tuple of values vik of attributes Ai. Each example is assigned one of Ncl possible values of the class variable C (classifications): ci, i∈{1,..., Ncl}. For instance, in the domain of early diagnosis of rheumatic diseases [12] and [30], the patient records comprise 16 anamnestic attributes. Some of these are continuous (e.g. age, duration of morning stiffness) and some are discrete (e.g. joint pain, which can be arthrotic, arthritic, or not present at all). There are eight possible diagnoses: degenerative spine diseases, degenerative joint diseases, inflammatory spine diseases, other inflammatory diseases, extraarticular rheumatism, crystal-induced synovitis, non-specific rheumatic manifestations, and non-rheumatic diseases.

To classify (diagnose) new cases, machine learning methods can take different approaches. They can construct explicit symbolic rules that generalize the training cases (rule induction and decision tree induction). The induced rules or decision trees can then be used to classify new cases. Another approach is to store (some of) the training cases for reference (instance-based learning). New cases can then be classified by comparing them to the reference cases. Yet another approach is to compute, for a given case to be classified, the conditional probability of classes according to the Bayesian formula and assign the most probable class to the case. These approaches are outlined in some more detail in the rest of this section.

3.1. Rule induction

Given a set of classified examples, a rule induction system constructs a set of if–then rules. An if–then rule has the form:

Full-size image (<1 K)
The condition part of a rule contains one or more attribute tests. The conclusion part has the form C=ci, assigning a particular value ci to the class C. We say that an example is covered by a rule if the attribute values of the example fulfil the conditions in the IF part of the rule.
An example rule induced in the domain of early diagnosis of rheumatic diseases [12] and [30] is given in Fig. 1. It assigns the diagnosis of crystal-induced synovitis to male patients older than 46 years that have more than three painful joints and psoriasis as a skin manifestation.
