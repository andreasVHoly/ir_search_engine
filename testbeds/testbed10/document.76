A large number of bacterial pathogens utilize secretion systems for pathogenesis. In these systems, a multi-protein complex is used to translocate a repertoire of proteins, termed effectors, into host cells during infection. These effector proteins were found to be critical for the pathogenicity of numerous pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica, Yersinia pestis,Pseudomonas syringae (utilizing a type-III secretion system) [1]–[3], Legionella pneumophila,Coxiella burnetii Helicobacter pylori, Bordetella pertussis, Agrobacterium tumefaciens,Bartonella henselae (utilizing a type-IV secretion system) [4]–[6], Vibrio cholerae,Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (utilizing other secretion systems)[7],[8], making them prime targets for research of bacterial virulence systems.
L. pneumophila is an intracellular γ-proteobacteria, which is the causative agent of Legionnaires' disease: a severe pneumonia-like disease in which the bacteria infect and replicate in human alveolar macrophages [9]. L. pneumophila also infects a wide range of protozoan hosts, which serve as their environmental reservoir [10],[11]. After internalization by their natural protozoan hosts or by alveolar macrophages, the bacteria are confined to a phagosome and utilize the Icm/Dot type IVb secretion system to subvert host cellular processes[12],[13]. A large number of L. pneumophila encoded proteins were found to be translocated into the host cell in an Icm/Dot dependent manner [6], [14]–[16]. Some of the translocated substrates were shown to manipulate host cellular activities, and it is believed that the vast majority of translocated proteins have a functional role during infection.
The first L. pneumophila effector, RalF, was identified based on sequence homology to an eukaryotic Guanine Exchange Factor (GEF) domain [17]. Since then, a total of 105 genes were identified as effectors using various approaches such as sequence homology to eukaryotic domains and markers for horizontal gene transfer [17]–[21], interactions with Icm/Dot components [22], transfer of proteins between bacteria [23], genetic assays in yeast [24]–[26], similar regulatory elements [27]–[29], and a predicted secretion signal [30]. Importantly, the cellular function of most effectors is still unknown, and for most of the effectors examined, their knockout failed to reveal an intracellular growth phenotype [20],[22],[26],[29],[31]. Moreover, in some cases, knocking-out a family of paralogous effector-encoding genes simultaneously produced no significant growth defect [23],[32]. These observations suggest the existence of redundancy in terms of effector functionality, or alternatively, some effectors may function only in specific hosts, showing no intracellular growth defect when absent during infection of other hosts.
The L. pneumophila Philadelphia-1 genome harbors 3,005 open reading frames (ORFs) [31]. Identifying ORFs that encode for effector proteins is critical for the understanding of the cellular processes involved in L. pneumophila pathogenesis. In this study, we developed a novel machine learning approach for the identification of effectors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to present the task of effector identification as a computational classification problem. Our approach aims to extract features that distinguish effectors from non-effectors. These features are based, in part, on a systematic review of known characteristics of effectors and in part, on the discovery of novel features. These extracted features were then used to train a variety of machine learning algorithms, which produced a list of predicted effectors sorted by their likelihood. We followed up our predictions with experimental validations, using the CyaA reporter system, which led to the discovery of 40 novel L. pneumophila effectors.




Machine learning algorithms
Machine learning algorithms were performed using the WEKA package [47]. The following classification algorithms were tested: Naïve Bayes, Bayesian networks, SVM (SMO), Neural networks (Multilayer perceptron), and a Voting algorithm that is based on these four algorithms. Feature selection was performed using a “Wrapper” to find the best performing features for each one of the algorithms, using hill-climbing search algorithms. The classifiers were trained on datasets in which the ratio of effectors to non-effectors was 1∶5. Specifically, as more effectors were included in the second and third phases, the number of non-effectors was increased accordingly to maintain this ratio.
The classification performance was evaluated on the train datasets for each classifier separately. Classification performance for each classifier was evaluated using 10-fold cross validation, i.e., 90% of the training data were randomly chosen and used to tune the parameters of each classifier, and the remaining 10% were used to evaluate the classifier performance [47]. The performance score is measured in terms of AUC, which accounts for both the fraction of true positives (correctly classified effectors) and false positives (ORFs erroneously classified as effectors). Since the performance depends on the division of the training data, the procedure is repeated 10 times, so that each 10% is used once to evaluate performance. Classifier accuracy is defined as the average over these 10 repeats. The classifier with the highest average AUC was used at each learning phase to predict effectors.
When we evaluated the classification performance of each feature group separately, a dataset in which the ratio of 1∶1 between effectors and non-effectors was used. This was done to avoid artificial high performance stemming from the excess of non-effectors in the training data.
The computer code used to implement the machine learning scheme described here is available in http://www.tau.ac.il/~talp/LegionellaMachineLearning.
