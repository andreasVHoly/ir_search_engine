Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) is the most important cause of mortality in developed as well as in developing countries. Therefore improvements and rationalization of diagnostic procedures and treatment of IHD are necessary. The usual procedure in IHD diagnosis consists of four diagnostic levels, which contain evaluation of signs and symptoms of the disease and ECG at rest, sequential ECG testing during a controlled exercise, myocardial scintigraphy and coronary angiography as a final test. Because suggestibility is possible, the results of each step are interpreted individually and only the results of the highest step are valid. The total amount of data available for each patient is too large to be efficiently and objectively evaluated by the clinicians. The goal of a rational diagnostic algorithm is to establish the conclusive diagnosis of IHD and to plan the most appropriate management of the disease using only the necessary diagnostic steps. This can be achieved by taking into account and evaluating all the information collected by different diagnostic methods according to their importance and diagnostic value. The performance of a diagnostic method is usually described as classification accuracy, sensitivity and specificity:
