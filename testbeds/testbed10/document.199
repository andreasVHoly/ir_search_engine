Machine Learning in Control of Functional Electrical
Stimulation Systems for Locomotion

TO DATE, most clinically applied functional electrical stimulation (FES) systems for restoration of locomotion
use a manually triggered open-loop control method. These
assistive systems integrate machine control, which is triggered
manually (volitionally), and biological control. The biological
control allows the subject to correct “errors” imposed
by the imperfections of the machine control and individual
factors such as muscle fatigue, spasticity, and changes in
the environmental conditions. Other FES systems use openloop
control based on the concept of “stored” sequences of
muscle activation associated with the phases of a normal
gait cycle. These sequences are based on averaged EMG
patterns recorded in able-bodied subjects while walking [3].
A computer control of electrical stimulation was proposed
[4] emphasizing muscular properties. Some investigators have
introduced formal modeling to solve global issues such as
standing stability, control strategies, and feedback design [5].
To improve performance, several strategies which include
feedback were tested for FES systems: 

A computer-controlled walking paradigm, incorporating
A closed-loop, nonanalytical, control method called ArtiA
rule-based control for hybrid assistive systems
An interactive principle for controlling a hybrid gait
Regardless of the technology or control principles utilized,
the achievements, including practicality, gait speed and endurance,
efficiency, etc., in subjects with spinal cord injuries
(SCI) are not substantially different. Bearing in mind that
it is necessary to integrate machine control with biological
control, and recent findings on the role of synergy and sensory
driven movements [19], a rule-based control (RBC) system
seems to be a promising control technique. The RBC has a
hierarchical structure, where the upper-level block controls
processes like stand up, take a step, walk, stop, sit down,
and receives volitional control from the user (see Fig. 1). A
lower-level block controls stimulation of the muscles whose
activity is required to produce different phases of the processes
controlled. The RBC should be able to function in various
environmental conditions and in a variety of modes of the
gait. However, the RBC is a finite state control method;
thus, it is necessary to include both upper and lower control
levels in the control-system design and to tune control signals
in order to provide smooth functional movements. Some of
the methods to fine-tune movements are digital proportional
(P) and proportional plus integral (PI) controls which are
implemented in many control applications. 

V. CONCLUSION
The results suggest that both algorithms can be used successfully
in this application but they may require specific
fine-tuning of the factors that influence their generalization
on new data, such as the size of the training set and the
preset training error level. Neither approach is better in all
circumstances. Most tasks can be done with either algorithm,
although the amount of work required to do the task may
differ. Features that are unique to only one technique may be
the determining factor in deciding which technique to employ
in a particular design. If the complexity of design will benefit
from the advantageous features of ALN and if a retraining
feature is required, then adaptive logic networks are the choice.
If small understandable decision trees are preferred, then the
choice is inductive learning technique. In a future work, we
plan to combine both techniques in order to exploit all of their
advantages. Inductive learning technique may be very useful for estimation of the relative importance of sensory inputs for
particular design and ALN may be used in a final control
system for its better generalization and retraining feature.
