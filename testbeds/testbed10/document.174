1. Artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence (AI) has been established as the area of computer science dedicated to production software capable of sophisticated, intelligent, computations similar to those that the human brain routinely performs. It includes methods, tools and systems devoted to simulate human methods of logical and inductive knowledge acquisition, reasoning of brain activity for solving problems. There are two main categories of AI developments. The first includes methods and systems that simulate human experience and draw conclusions from a set of rules, such as expert systems. The second includes systems that model the way the brain works, for example, artificial neural networks (ANNs).
Expert systems are knowledge-based systems, an extension of conventional computing and are sometimes called the fifth generation of computing. This knowledge base allows an expert to define the rules that simulate a process of thinking and provides a simple way to draw conclusions and solve problems by following a set of rules. The idea of expert systems is that logical thinking can be modelled by compiling lists of logical propositions and performing logical transformations upon them. Expert systems are useful for medical diagnosis, and other diagnostic problem solving [1] and [2]. It provides a guide for prediction and decision making in environments involving uncertainty and vagueness. Medical practice, for example, is often hampered by incomplete and inexact scientific models of human health and disease, and incomplete or sometimes inaccurate data about individual patients.

ANNs are digitized models of a human brain, computer programs designed to simulate the way in which human brain processes information. ANNs learn (or are trained) through experience with appropriate learning exemplars just as people do, not from programming. Neural networks gather their knowledge by detecting the patterns and relationships in data. The brain is an excellent pattern recognition tool. When we look at a pen, we know it is a pen because biological neurons in a certain area of our brain have come across a similar input pattern on previous occasions and have learned to link that specific pattern with the object description ‘pen’. Since our brain contains billions of neurons which are fully interconnected, we can learn and recognize an almost endless variety of input patterns.

An average brain contains ∼100 billion neurons, each of which has 1000–10 000 connections with other neurons. Neurons consist of a cell body which includes nucleus that controls the cell activity, many fine treads, dendrites, that carry information into the cell, and one longer thread known as the axon which carries the signal away (Fig. 1). Impulses pass along the axon to the synapse, the junction between one neuron and the next and signals are passed from one to the next in an all-or-none fashion. Neurons are organised in a fully connected network and act like messenger in receiving and sending impulses. The result is an intelligent brain capable of learning, prediction and recognition.
