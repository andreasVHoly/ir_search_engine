Data mining techniques (DMT) have formed a branch of applied artificial intelligence (AI), since the 1960s. During the intervening decades, important innovations in computer systems have led to the introduction of new technologies (Ha, Bae, & Park, 2000), for web-based education. Data mining allows a search, for valuable information, in large volumes of data (Weiss & Indurkhya, 1998). The explosive growth in databases has created a need to develop technologies that use information and knowledge intelligently. Therefore, DMT has become an increasingly important research area (Fayyad, Djorgovski, & Weir, 1996). Of the data mining techniques developed recently, several major kinds of data mining methods, including generalization, characterization, classification, clustering, association, evolution, pattern matching, data visualization and meta-rule guided mining, are herein reviewed. The techniques for mining knowledge from different kinds of databases, including relational, transactional, object oriented, spatial and active databases, as well as global information systems, are also examined. Potential data mining applications and some research issues are discussed. As an element of DMT research, this paper surveys the development of DMT, through a literature review and the classification of articles, from 2000 to 2011. The various applications of DMT, during that period, are reviewed. This period is especially important, because the Internet was opened to general users, in 2000, and the newly widespread availability of information and communication technology has played an important role, not only in the field of DMT, but also in the development of methodologies for the collection of data from online databases. The period of interest, for this literature survey, begins in January 2000. In August, 2011, a search was made of the keyword indices on the Elsevier SCOPUS, Springerlink, IEEE Xplore, EBSCO (electronic journal service) and Wiley InterScience online database, for article abstracts containing the phrase, ‘‘data mining technique’’. For the period from 2000 to 2011, 14,972 articles were found. Topic filtering reduced this number to 216 articles, from 159 journals, which were related to the keyword, ‘‘Data mining application’’. Using these 216 articles on DMT applications, this paper surveys and classifies DMT, using nine categories: Neural networks, Algorithm architecture, dynamic prediction-based, Analysis of systems architecture, Intelligence agent systems, Modeling, knowledge-based systems, System optimization and Information systems, together with their applications in different research and practical domains. The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows. Sections 3–11 present the survey results for DMT methodologies and applications, based on the categories mentioned, above. Section 12 is a discussion of suggestions for the future development of DMT methodologies and their applications. Finally, Section 13 contains a brief conclusion.

13. Conclusions

This paper presents a review of literature concerned with DMT and its applications, from 2000 to 2011. It used a search of keyword indices and article titles. It is concluded that development of DMT is tending to become more expertise-oriented and that the development of DMT applications is more problem-centered. It is suggested that different social science methodologies, such as psychology, cognitive science and human behavior might use DMT as an alternative methodology. Integration of qualitative, quantitative and scientific methods and the integration of studies of DMT methodologies will increase understanding of the subject. Finally, the ability to continually change and provide new understanding is the principle advantage of DMT methodologies, and will be at the core of DMT applications, in future.
