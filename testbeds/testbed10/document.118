1. Introduction
Pattern recognition forms a fundamental solution to different
problems in real world applications (Kogan & Margoliash, 1998).
The function of pattern recognition is to categorize an unknown
pattern into a distinct class based on a suitable similarity measure.
Thus similar patterns are assigned to the same classes while dissimilar
patterns are classified into different classes.
Features used in sound recognition applications are usually chosen
such that they represent some meaningful characteristics.
Selection of actual features used in recognition is a critical part
for the recognition system. Frog sound can be seen as an organized
sequence of brief sounds from a species-specific vocabulary. Those
brief sounds are usually called syllables (Duellman & Trueb, 1986).
Through the use of pre-processing, we can extract those useful syllables
and compute features for pattern recognition usage.
In general, features include time domain features, frequency domain
features. Time domain features are calculated directly from
the sound waveform such as zero crossing rate and signal energy.
Frequency domain features signal is first transformed to the frequency
domain using Fourier transform and features are calculated
from transformed signal such as frequency.
In speech recognition, a source model is assumed and the signal
is expected to obey the laws of a specific spoken language with a
vocabulary and a grammar. Frog vocalization is a representative instance
of a category of natural sounds where a vocabulary and
other structural elements are expected. In comparison with the human
speech recognition problem, animal sounds are usually simpler
to recognize. Speech recognition often proceeds in a quiet
and similar environment, while frog’s sounds are usually recorded
in a much noisy environment, under which we must recognize
simpler vocalizations.
Recently, most of research work on recognition of animal calls
focused on animal species identification, such as bird species identification
(Tyagi, Hegde, Murthy, & Prabhakar, 2006; Vilches, Escobar,
Vallejo, & Taylor, 2006; Somervuo, Härmä, & Fagerlund, 2006).
To identify different species of animals according to recorded calls
helped people understanding animal calls. Tyagi et al. (2006) introduced
a new representation for bird syllables which was based on
the average spectrum over time and classification was based on
template matching. Vilches et al. (2006) used data mining techniques
for classification and analyses were performed on a pulseby-pulse
basis in contrast to traditional syllable-based systems.
Somervuo et al. studied different parametric representations of
bird syllables in Somervuo et al. (2006). Notably, all of the
above-mentioned research work focused on bird calls. The collection
of bird call samples turns out to be not so difficult because
most of the birds can be seen and their calls can be heard during
the daytime.
Some investigations consider animal calls among different animal
calls (Mitrovic & Zeppelzauer, 2006; Guo & Li, 2003). Mitrovic
and Zeppelzauer (2006) used machine learning technology to recognize
different animal calls. Recognition classes include birds,
cats, cows and dogs. Guo and Li (2003) employed support vector
machines to identify 16 different classes of animal sounds.
Frog-watching/frog-hearing is one of the favorite leisure-time
hobbies and outdoor teaching activities in Taiwan, although frog
sound is not well recognizable by most people. Currently, people have to consult frog biologists in person or on the phone to recognize
the recorded frog sound due to the lack of online frog sound
database available on Internet. To the best of our knowledge, no researcher
has been devoted to developing automatic frog sound recognition
system in the literature. It thus becomes essential to
construct a frog sound recognition system to satisfy the increasing
demand of the public.
In this work, an online frog sound identification system is constructed
based on audio signals sampled from recordings of frog
sounds in an outdoor environment. The family Microhylidae, such
as Microhyla heymonsi, Kaloula pulchra, Microhyla butleri, Microhyla
ornate and Microhyla steinegeri, are collected as the test samples.
We try to detect accurate syllables because accurate syllables are
useful for describing temporal features for frog sounds such as
zero-crossing rate and threshold-crossing rate. The experimental
results exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed work.
This article is organized as follows. In Section 2, the classification
algorithm and the feature extraction methods, including segmentation
of frog sounds into syllables and parametric
representations of frog vocalization, is presented. Experimental results
and analysis is given in Section 3. Finally, Section 4 concludes
the work.

4. Conclusion and feature work
An automatic frog sound identification system is proposed in
this work to provide the public to consult online. The sound samples
are first properly segmented into syllables. Two well-known
classifiers, kNN and SVM, are employed to recognize the frog species
based on the extracted features, spectral centroid, signal bandwidth
and threshold-crossing rate. A series of experiments were
performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
The average classification accuracy is up to 89.05% and 90.30%
for kNN and SVM classifiers, respectively. It can be seen from the
experimental results that the proposed on-line recognition system
is adequate for the identification of frog sounds.
Based on the results of this study, there seem to be certain frog
species which are able to be easily recognized by the proposed
methods, whereas the characteristics of the sounds of some species,
such as Microhyla butleri and Microhyla ornate, clearly require
further analysis. We thus intend to develop new techniques in the
feature to extract the features of the sounds for some specific frog species, whose classification accuracy rate falls below average,
such as Microhyla butleri and Microhyla ornate.
