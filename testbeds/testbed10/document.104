1. Introduction
Over the past decade, several financial crises observed in
some emerging markets enjoying financial liberalization
showed that debt financing could result in large and sudden
capital outflows, thereby causing a domestic ‘credit crunch.’
This experience made banking authorities such as Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) learn a number of lessons,
among which they all encourage commercial banks to
develop internal models to better quantify financial risks
(Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 1999). Decision
making problems in the area of credit evaluation have been
considered very important but difficult ones for financial
institutions due to a high level of risk from wrong decisions.
In order to effectively manage the credit risk exposures of
financial institutions, there is a strong need for sophisticated
decision support systems backed by analytical tools to
measure, monitor, manage, and control financial and operational risks as well as inefficiencies (Emel, Oral,
Reisman, & Yolalan, 2003; Park & Han, 2002).
A potential client’s credit risk is often evaluated by
financial institutions’ internal credit scoring models, which
aim to determine whether an applicant has the capability to
repay by evaluating the risk of his loan application. Such
models offer them a means for evaluating the risk of their
credit portfolio, in a timely manner, by centralizing globalexposures
data and by analyzing marginal as well as absolute
contributions to risk components. Armed with these models,
quantitative risk management systems can thus provide the
financial institutions early warning signals for potential
business failures of the clients (Chen & Huang, 2003; Lee,
Chiu, Lu, & Chen, 2002; Lopez & Saidenberg, 2000; West,
2000).
So far, linear probability and multivariate conditional
probability models, the recursive partitioning algorithm,
artificial intelligence, multi-criteria decision making, mathematical
programming have been proposed to support the
credit decision (Bryant, 1997; Butta, 1994; Cielen &
Vanhoof, 1999; Coakley & Brown, 2000; Davis, Edelman,
& Gammerman, 1992; Diakoulaki, Mavrotas, & Papayan
nakis, 1992; Dimitras, Zanakis, & Zopounidis, 1996;Emel et al., 2003; Falbo, 1991; Frydman, Altman, & Kao,
1985; Jo & Han, 1996; Lee, Sung, & Chang, 1999; Martin,
1997; Reichert, Cho, & Wagner, 1983; Roy, 1991; Tam &
Kiang, 1992; Troutt et al., 1996; Zopounidis & Doumpos,
1998). In particular, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are
most frequently used in previous literature since the power
of prediction is known to be better than the others; however,
it has been commonly reported that ANN models require a
large amount of training data to estimate the distribution of
input pattern, and they have difficulties of generalizing the
results because of their overfitting nature. In addition, it
fully depends on researchers’ experience or knowledge to
preprocess data in order to select control parameters
including relevant input variables, hidden layer size,
learning rate, and momentum (Gemen et al., 1992;
Lawrence, Giles, & Tsoi, 1997; Moody, 1992; Sarle,
1995; Smith, 1993; Weigend, 1994).

5. Conclusions
In this paper, we applied SVM to bankruptcy prediction
problem, and showed its attractive prediction power
compared to the existing methods. Mapping input vectors
into a high-dimensional feature space, SVM transforms
complex problems (with complex decision surfaces) into
simpler problems that can use linear discriminant functions,
and it has been successfully introduced in several financial
applications recently. Achieving similar to or better
performance than BPNs in practical applications, SVM
can conduct classification learning with relatively small
amount of data. Also, embodying the structural risk
minimization principle (SRM), SVM may prevent the
overfitting problem and makes its solution global optimum
since the feasible region is convex set.
Particularly in this study, we utilize a grid-search
technique using 5-fold cross-validation in order to choose
optimal values of the upper bound C and the kernel
parameter g that are most important in SVM model
selection. Selecting the optimal parameter values through
the grid-search, we could build a bankruptcy prediction
model with high stability and prediction power. To validate
the prediction performance of this model, we statistically
compared its prediction accuracy with those of standard
three-layer fully connected BPNs, MDA, and Logit,
respectively. The results of empirical analysis showed that
SVM outperformed the other methods. With these results,
we claim that SVM can serve as a promising alternative for
the bankruptcy prediction.
While this study used RBF kernel as a basic kernel
function of SVM model, it should be noted that the
appropriate kernel function can be problem-specific; hence
it remains an interesting topic for further study to derive
judicious procedures to select proper kernel functions and
the corresponding parameter values according to the types
of classification problems.
