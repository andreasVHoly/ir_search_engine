INTRODUCTION
There are a number of standard methodologies used
to assess community structure from benthic video and
still images. Assessments tend to quantify either numbers
of individuals or the percentage of seabed covered
by either a particular substrate or species within
an image or video still (Jaap & McField 2001). How this
is carried out varies with methodology. Perhaps the
most commonly used method is the point quadrat
method (Pielou 1974). This method entails overlaying
the image or still with an array of points (number of
points variable; increasing the number of points
increases both accuracy and assessment effort) and
quantifying the number of points intersecting with the
various species and/or substrates within the image.
Another approach is to map all the species and substrates
present in an image onto a video or digital overlay
and determine from this the percentage coverage
of each organism or substrate (Andrew & Mapstone

1987). Although the assessment effort is much higher
with this second method, accuracy is greatly improved
(Foster et al. 1991, Whorff & Griffing 1992).
Accuracy and efficiency of these methods has been
investigated in a selection of ecosystems, such as tropical
coral reefs (Leujak & Ormond 2007). Their usefulness
in some environments, such as within cold-water
coral ecosystems, has not been rigorously assessed. In
this pilot study, we compare the ability of these 2 methods
to assess some aspects of cold-water coral community
structure at Tisler Reef, Norway. Additionally
these results are compared with those produced by a
wholly new approach: the use of machine-learning
algorithms in the automated identification and quantification
of cold-water coral and sponge coverage
within still images extracted from video footage.
Cold-water coral ecosystems have been found
throughout the world’s oceans (Roberts et al. 2006). In
European waters, they are often associated with coldwater
carbonate mounds, ridges at the edge of the continental
shelf or at other elevated structures such as
banks and sills (White et al. 2005, Dorschel et al. 2007).
Key organisms in these ecosystems are the frameworkbuilding
scleractinian corals (Roberts et al. 2006).
These non-zooxanthellate animals form complex 3-
dimensional reef structures as they excrete hard calcium
carbonate skeletons during growth (Rogers 1999,
Hovland 2008). As a reef develops over time, this structure
can attain significant height above the surrounding
seabed (De Mol et al. 2007) despite the slow
growth rates of the corals themselves (Gass & Roberts
2006, Orejas et al. 2008). In Europe, Lophelia pertusa
is the most significant reef-building coral species
(Wheeler et al. 2007), although Madrepora oculata can
also be found performing this role at certain locations,
often in close association with L. pertusa (Mortensen et
al. 2008). The reef structures are characterized by high
biodiversity (Jonsson et al. 2004, Roberts et al. 2008), as
the dead skeletal material of the reef provides a useful
substrate for sessile filter feeders such as sponges
(Henry & Roberts 2007). Furthermore, the increased
flow associated with elevation from the seabed
increases food supply (Thiem et al. 2006, Kiriakoulakis
et al. 2007). Many species of small and juvenile fish use
these reef structures as nursery habitat, as they provide
shelter from predation (Reed 2002). Commercial
fish densities within the reef environment are often
higher than in the surrounding ocean (Husebø et al.
2002, Costello et al. 2005). Although cold-water corals
have been known since the 18th century (Roberts et al.
2003), the extent of seabed covered by these organisms
and associated ecosystems, as well as their potential
importance to commercial fisheries, only emerged
in the late 20th century (Costello et al. 2005). Advances
in marine sampling technology indicate that these ecosystems are relatively common in European waters,
and many reefs have been located in recent years
(Roberts et al. 2005, Wienberg et al. 2008). Unfortunately,
these discoveries are rarely of pristine reefs.
The majority show signs of impacts from towed fishing
gears (Fosså et al. 2002). Common indicators of such
impacts are dislodged blocks of live coral, snagged and
abandoned fishing equipment and extended areas of
broken coral fragments amongst trawl tracks. Various
legal attempts to protect a percentage of these reefs
against further damage have been made by a number
of nations (Armstrong & van den Hove 2008) with variable
success (Davies et al. 2007)
