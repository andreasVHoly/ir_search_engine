The Internet has become a part of daily life and an essential tool today. It aids people in many areas, such as business, entertainment and education, etc. In particular, Internet has been used as an important component of business models (Shon & Moon, 2007). For the business operation, both business and customers apply the Internet application such as website and e-mail on business activities. Therefore, information security of using Internet as the media needs to be carefully concerned. Intrusion detection is one major research problem for business and personal networks. As there are many risks of network attacks under the Internet environment, there are various systems designed to block the Internet-based attacks. Particularly, intrusion detection systems (IDSs) aid the network to resist external attacks. That is, the goal of IDSs is to provide a wall of defense to confront the attacks of computer systems on Internet. IDSs can be used on detect difference types of malicious network communications and computer systems usage, whereas the conventional firewall can not perform this task. Intrusion detection is based on the assumption that the behavior of intruders different from a legal user (Stallings, 2006). In general, IDSs can be divided into two categories: anomaly and misuse (signature) detection based on their detection approaches (Anderson, 1995; Rhodes, Mahaffey, & Cannady, 2000). Anomaly detection tries to determine whether deviation from the established normal usage patterns can be flagged as intrusions. On the other hand, misuse detection uses patterns of well-known attacks or weak spots of the system to identify intrusions. In literature, numbers of anomaly detection systems are developed based on many different machine learning techniques (c.f. Section 3). For example, some studies apply single learning techniques, such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, support vector machines, etc. On the other hand, some systems are based on combining different learning techniques, such as hybrid or ensemble techniques. In particular, these techniques are developed as classifiers, which are used to classify or recognize whether the incoming Internet access is the normal access or an attack. However, there is no a review of these different machine learning techniques over the intrusion detection domain. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to review 55 related studies/ systems published from 2000 to 2007 by examining what techniques have been used, what experiments have been conducted, and what should be considered for future work based on the machine learning’s perspective. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of machine learning techniques and briefly describes a number of related techniques for intrusion detection. Section 3 compares related work based on the types of classifier design, the chosen baselines, datasets used for experiments, etc. Conclusion and discussion for future research are given in Section 4. Pattern recognition is the action to take raw data and activity on data category (Michalski, Bratko, & Kubat, 1998). The methods of supervised and unsupervised learning can be used to solve different pattern recognition problems (Theodoridis & Koutroumbas, 2006, 2006). In supervised learning, it is based on using the training data to create a function, in which each of the training data contains a pair of the input vector and output (i.e. the class label). The learning (training) task is to compute the approximate distance between the input–output examples to create a classifier (model). When the model is created, it can classify unknown examples into a learned class labels. 2.2. Single classifiers The intrusion detection problem can be approached by using one single machine learning algorithm. In literature, machine learning techniques (e.g. k-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, artificial neural network, decision trees, self-organizing maps, etc.) have been used to solve these problems.
