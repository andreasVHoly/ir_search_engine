Over the last few years, the term ‘data mining’ has been increasingly used in the medical literature. In general, the term has not been anchored to any precise definition but to some sort of common understanding of its meaning: the use of (novel) methods and tools to analyze large amounts of data. Data mining has been applied with success to different fields of human endeavor, including marketing, banking, customer relationship management, engineering and various areas of science. However, its application to the analysis of medical data – despite high hopes – has until recently been relatively limited. This is particularly true of practical applications in clinical medicine which may benefit from specific data mining approaches that are able to perform predictive modeling, exploit the knowledge available in the clinical domain and explain proposed decisions once the models are used to support clinical decisions. The goal of predictive data mining in clinical medicine is to derive models that can use patientspecific information to predict the outcome of interest and to thereby support clinical decision-making. Predictive data mining methods may be applied to the construction of decision models for procedures such as prognosis, diagnosis and treatment planning, which – once evaluated and verified – may be embedded within clinical information systems. In this paper, we give a methodological review of data mining, focusing on its data analysis process and highlighting some of the most relevant issues related to its application in clinical medicine. We limit the paper’s scope to predictive data mining whose methods are methodologically ripe and often easily available and may be particularly suitable for the class of problems arising from clinical data analysis and decision support. Data mining is the process of selecting, exploring and modeling large amounts of data in order to discover unknown patterns or relationships which provide a clear and useful result to the data analyst [1]. Coined in the mid-1990s, the term data mining has today become a synonym for ‘Knowledge Discovery in Databases’ which, as proposed by Fayyad et al. [2], emphasized the data analysis process rather than the use of specific analysis methods. Data mining problems are often solved by using a mosaic of different approaches drawn from computer science, including multi-dimensional databases, machine learning, soft computing and data visualization, and from statistics, including hypothesis testing, clustering, classification and regression techniques. The craft of data mining lies in the appropriate choice and combination of these techniques to efficiently and reliably solve a given problem. Data mining tasks can, in general, be classified to tasks of description and prediction. While description aims at finding human-interpretable patterns and associations, after considering the data as a whole and constructing a model prediction seeks to foretell some response of interest. Although the goals of description and prediction may overlap (the models generated by some prediction methods may point out some interesting patterns), the main distinction is that prediction requires the data to include a special response variable. The response may be categorical or numerical, thus further classifying predictive data mining as, respectively, classification and regression. In this review we address classification problems in particular: while the difference between the two lies mainly in the set of methods used, the data mining process applied to regression and classification problems is quite similar. Before we go on, we use a simple example to introduce the basic concepts in predictive data mining and to show the application of two popular but quite different data classification techniques.
