1. Introduction
Classification is one of the most widely applied tasks in ecology, and has been encountered in a variety of contexts, such as suitable site assessment for ecological conservation and restoration (e.g., Chase and Rothley, 2007), bioindicator identification (Kampichler and Platen, 2004), vegetation mapping by remote sensing (Steele, 2000), risk assessment systems for introduced species (Caley and Kuhnert, 2006), and species distribution and habitat models (e.g., Guisan and Thuiller, 2005). In most cases, ecologists have to deal with noisy, high-dimensional data that are strongly non-linear and which do not meet the assumptions of conventional statistical procedures (Recknagel, 2001). To overcome this problem, machine-learning methods have been increasingly adopted as ecological classification methods over the last 20 years. The most popular of these are classification trees and artificial neural networks (De'ath and Fabricius, 2000, Recknagel, 2001 and Özesmi et al., 2006). New data mining approaches are continually being developed, thus steadily increasing the number of available methods. Diversification of the ecological toolbox is not always an advantage, however. Some methods are computationally intensive and there are few guidelines or standard procedures available, causing some confusion among ecologists over which method should be selected for a given classification problem.

Various attempts have been made to popularise machine-learning based classification methods among ecologists, and through a series of comparisons, identify their strengths and weaknesses for different applications (Thuiller et al., 2003, Segurado and Araújo, 2004, Benito-Garzón et al., 2006, Elith et al., 2006, Leathwick et al., 2006, Moisen et al., 2006, Prasad et al., 2006, Cutler et al., 2007, Peters et al., 2007 and Meynard and Quinn, 2007). Different methods (including classification trees, random forests, bagging, artificial neural networks, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and genetic algorithms, among others) have been tested and compared with one another or with more conventional statistical procedures such as generalised linear models and discriminant analysis. Due to the large number of methods and their alternatives (e.g., the various algorithms for inducing classification trees and the different methods for improving their efficiency such as pruning and boosting), the picture is still far from complete or conclusive and many questions remain unanswered (Elith et al., 2006). Moreover, the adoption of a new method depends not only on its efficiency, but also on how comprehensible it is, how much time is necessary to learn and understand it, how easily can its results be interpreted, and whether it requires specialised software or can be executed in an already familiar environment. In this paper, we compare five machine-learning methods against the traditional classification technique of discriminant function analysis (DA).

The majority of articles that we examined and which were testing novel classification methods in the context of distribution and habitat modelling have used binary classification, i.e., presence or absence of a species. In the present paper the techniques of classification trees, random forests, artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and automatically generated fuzzy classifiers were tested, along with DA, for a case with multiple classes, viz., the analysis of abundance and distribution loss of the ocellated turkey (Meleagris ocellata), an endangered species that is endemic to the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico.

The ocellated turkey (OT) is a large and easily recognisable bird whose geographic range encompasses the Mexican states of Yucatán, Campeche and Quintana Roo, together with the Guatemalan department of El Petén and the northern portion of Belize (Howell and Webb, 1995). Calmé et al. (in press) have demonstrated a considerable loss of distributional area and local abundance of the OT between 1980 and 2000, based on an analysis of 688 grid cells (10 × 10 km each) distributed throughout the Mexican part of the species' range. Over this 20-year period, OT went extinct in 16.6% of the cells, while its local abundance decreased in 34.6% of the cells. Most probably, colonisation from other regions of Mexico, which began in the 1970s, and its immediate consequences, such as increased levels of subsistence hunting (Quijano-Hernández and Calmé, 2002) and deforestation, have driven OT abundance below a critical threshold. The current decrease of OT abundance is apparently decoupled from external factors (Kampichler et al., submitted for publication), from which it is concluded that the OT has encountered an extinction vortex very similar to the model proposed by Oborny et al. (2005). This model predicts spontaneously fragmenting populations with, consequently, failing density regulation.

The five machine-learning based classification methods that we used to model OT abundance changes have included those that have yet to be or which have been rarely been tested in an ecological application. Classification trees and neural networks are frequently used in ecological data analysis (e.g. De'ath and Fabricius, 2000, Schultz et al., 2000, Henderson et al., 2005, Jones et al., 2006, Özesmi et al., 2006 and Lee et al., 2007) and random forests are gaining increasing interest (Benito-Garzón et al., 2006, Lawler et al., 2006, Cutler et al., 2007, Peters et al., 2007 and Kampichler et al., submitted for publication), but support vector machines and automatically generated fuzzy classifiers have been only rarely used (Guo et al., 2005, Drake et al., 2006 and Tscherko et al., 2007). We compared the classification efficiency of these methods, as measured by total classification error as well as by normalized mutual information (Forbes, 1995), and then compared them with the more conventional linear discriminant analysis.

5. Conclusion
A modelling technique that works well for a given class of modelling problem was not necessarily appropriate for another one. In ecology and biological conservation, a classifier should be transparent and easily interpreted, thereby allowing detected knowledge (e.g., a set of rules that relates a class to explanatory variables) to be transformed into concrete guidelines for conservation. The classification technique should be straight forward and intuitively graspable to permit broad use by the ecological community, and communication with conservation managers, decision makers, and last, but not least, the public. In the context presented in this paper, BPNN and to a certain degree SVM do not appear to be promising tools, although they are extremely successful methods in other domains, whereas methods that might be regarded as old-fashioned by machine-learning specialists, CT in this case, appear to be quite powerful. We recommend the application of CT and RF to ecological classification problems due to their high modelling accuracy as well as their transparency and comprehensibility. In any case, interpretable models should be preferred to black box models unless prediction is the only objective of the classification task.
