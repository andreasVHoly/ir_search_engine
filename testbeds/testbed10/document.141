Data clustering: 50 years beyond K-means q

1. Introduction
Advances in sensing and storage technology and dramatic
growth in applications such as Internet search, digital imaging,
and video surveillance have created many high-volume, highdimensional
data sets. It is estimated that the digital universe consumed
approximately 281 exabytes in 2007, and it is projected to
be 10 times that size by 2011 (1 exabyte is 1018 bytes or
1,000,000 terabytes) (Gantz, 2008). Most of the data is stored digitally
in electronic media, thus providing huge potential for the
development of automatic data analysis, classification, and retrieval
techniques. In addition to the growth in the amount of data,
the variety of available data (text, image, and video) has also increased.
Inexpensive digital and video cameras have made available
huge archives of images and videos. The prevalence of RFID
tags or transponders due to their low cost and small size has resulted
in the deployment of millions of sensors that transmit data
regularly. E-mails, blogs, transaction data, and billions of Web
pages create terabytes of new data every day. Many of these data streams are unstructured, adding to the difficulty in analyzing
them.
The increase in both the volume and the variety of data requires
advances in methodology to automatically understand, process,
and summarize the data. Data analysis techniques can be broadly
classified into two major types (Tukey, 1977): (i) exploratory or
descriptive, meaning that the investigator does not have pre-specified
models or hypotheses but wants to understand the general
characteristics or structure of the high-dimensional data, and (ii)
confirmatory or inferential, meaning that the investigator wants
to confirm the validity of a hypothesis/model or a set of assumptions
given the available data. Many statistical techniques have
been proposed to analyze the data, such as analysis of variance,
linear regression, discriminant analysis, canonical correlation
analysis, multi-dimensional scaling, factor analysis, principal component
analysis, and cluster analysis to name a few. A useful
overview is given in (Tabachnick and Fidell, 2007).
In pattern recognition, data analysis is concerned with predictive
modeling: given some training data, we want to predict the
behavior of the unseen test data. This task is also referred to as
learning. Often, a clear distinction is made between learning problems
that are (i) supervised (classification) or (ii) unsupervised
(clustering), the first involving only labeled data (training patterns
with known category labels) while the latter involving only unlabeled
data (Duda et al., 2001). Clustering is a more difficult and challenging problem than classification. There is a growing interest
in a hybrid setting, called semi-supervised learning (Chapelle et al.,
2006); in semi-supervised classification, the labels of only a small
portion of the training data set are available. The unlabeled data,
instead of being discarded, are also used in the learning process.
In semi-supervised clustering, instead of specifying the class labels,
pair-wise constraints are specified, which is a weaker way of
encoding the prior knowledge. A pair-wise must-link constraint
corresponds to the requirement that two objects should be assigned
the same cluster label, whereas the cluster labels of two objects
participating in a cannot-link constraint should be different.
Constraints can be particularly beneficial in data clustering (Lange
et al., 2005; Basu et al., 2008), where precise definitions of underlying
clusters are absent. In the search for good models, one would
like to include all the available information, no matter whether it is
unlabeled data, data with constraints, or labeled data. Fig. 1 illustrates
this spectrum of different types of learning problems of
interest in pattern recognition and machine learning.

5. Summary
Organizing data into sensible groupings arises naturally in
many scientific fields. It is, therefore, not surprising to see the continued
popularity of data clustering. It is important to remember
that cluster analysis is an exploratory tool; the output of clustering
algorithms only suggest hypotheses. While numerous clustering
algorithms have been published and new ones continue to appear,
there is no single clustering algorithm that has been shown to
dominate other algorithms across all application domains. Most
algorithms, including the simple K-means, are admissible algorithms.
With the emergence of new applications, it has become
increasingly clear that the task of seeking the best clustering principle
might indeed be futile. As an example, consider the application
domain of enterprise knowledge management. Given the
same set of document corpus, different user groups (e.g., legal,
marketing, management, etc.) may be interested in generating partitions
of documents based on their respective needs. A clustering
method that satisfies the requirements for one group of users may
not satisfy the requirements of another. As mentioned earlier,
‘‘clustering is in the eye of the beholder” – so indeed data clustering
must involve the user or application needs.
Clustering has numerous success stories in data analysis. In
spite of this, machine learning and pattern recognition communities
need to address a number of issues to improve our understanding
of data clustering. Below is a list of problems and research
directions that are worth focusing in this regard
