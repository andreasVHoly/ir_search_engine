Artificial neural networks: fundamentals, computing, design, and
application

I.A. Basheer , M. Hajmeer

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are relatively new computational tools that have found extensive utilization in solving
many complex real-world problems. The attractiveness of ANNs comes from their remarkable information processing
characteristics pertinent mainly to nonlinearity, high parallelism, fault and noise tolerance, and learning and generalization
capabilities. This paper aims to familiarize the reader with ANN-based computing (neurocomputing) and to serve as a useful
companion practical guide and toolkit for the ANNs modeler along the course of ANN project development. The history of
the evolution of neurocomputing and its relation to the field of neurobiology is briefly discussed. ANNs are compared to both
expert systems and statistical regression and their advantages and limitations are outlined. A bird’s eye review of the various
types of ANNs and the related learning rules is presented, with special emphasis on backpropagation (BP) ANNs theory and
design. A generalized methodology for developing successful ANNs projects from conceptualization, to design, to
implementation, is described. The most common problems that BPANNs developers face during training are summarized in
conjunction with possible causes and remedies. Finally, as a practical application, BPANNs were used to model the microbial
growth curves of S. flexneri. The developed model was reasonably accurate in simulating both training and test
time-dependent growth curves as affected by temperature and pH.  2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.
