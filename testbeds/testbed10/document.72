Clinical decisions regarding the treatment of brain neoplasms rely, in part, on MRI at various stages of the treatment process. Radiologic diagnosis is based on the multiparametric imaging profile (CT, conventional MRI, advanced MRI). Tumor characterization is difficult because neoplastic tissue is often heterogeneous in spatial and imaging profiles (1), and for some imaging techniques often overlaps with normal tissue (especially the infiltrating part) (2, 3). Gliomas might show mixed characteristics; for example, demonstrating both low- and high-grade features. The reference standard for characterizing brain neoplasms is currently based on histopathologic analysis following surgical biopsy or resection, but this also has limitations, including sampling error and variability in interpretation (1, 4).
The objective of this study is to provide an automated tool that may assist in the imaging evaluation of brain neoplasms by determining the glioma grade and differentiating between different tissue types, such as primary neoplasms (gliomas) from secondary neoplasms (metastases). These issues are of critical clinical importance in making decisions regarding initial and evolving treatment strategies, and conventional MR imaging is often not adequate in providing answers (1, 5). Automated tools, if proven accurate, can ultimately be applied to (i) provide more reliable differentiation, especially when the neoplasm is heterogeneous and therefore cannot be adequately sampled by localized needle biopsy; (ii) avoid invasive procedures such as biopsy, especially in cases where the risks outweigh the benefits; and (iii) expedite or anticipate the diagnosis (histologic examination is usually time consuming).
Toward a similar goal, researchers used conventional MR imaging and echo-planar relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps calculated from perfusion imaging to differentiate between high-grade and low-grade neoplasms (6) or assessed the contribution of MR perfusion alone in differentiating certain tumor types (7, 8). Many studies have used MR spectroscopy for brain tumor classification (9–11). Specifically, spectroscopic and conventional MR imaging was used in Wang et al. (9) to differentiate benign from malignant brain neoplasms, applying a decision tree algorithm, whereas spectroscopic and perfusion MRI was used in Weber et al. (10) to evaluate the inherent heterogeneity of brain neoplasms by defining four regions of interest (ROIs) in the tumoral and peritumoral region. Some studies used apparent diffusion coefficient maps computed from diffusion tensor imaging data to differentiate metastases from primary cerebral tumors (by measuring diffusion in peritumoral edema) (12) or combined apparent diffusion coefficient with rCBV to differentiate tumefactive demyelinating lesions and primary neoplasms from abscesses and lymphomas (13).
The previous studies are very useful in determining the clinical significance of each MR sequence separately; however, they do not investigate nonlinear relationships between different variables by pattern analysis. Pattern classification techniques were applied for differentiating brain neoplasms based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) (14, 15), or independent component analysis (16) on spectral intensities. Others applied support vector machines (SVMs) on perfusion MRI (17) or combined variable selection and classification using bayesian least squares SVMs and relevance vector machines on microarray or spectroscopy data (18). Textural features from T1postcontrast images were employed in (19) to discriminate between metastatic and primary brain tumors using a probabilistic neural network with a nonlinear least squares features transformation method. Although these studies apply more advanced machine learning techniques, they use a single MR sequence and do not investigate the contribution of multiple imaging parameters. Multiparametric features are explored by nonlinear classification techniques in (20, 21). Li et al. (20) classify gliomas according to their clinical grade using linear SVMs trained on a maximum of 15 descriptive features (such as amount of mass effect or blood supply), which are estimated quantitatively by domain experts. The definition of such features is based on expert knowledge and therefore is not completely automated and reproducible. Devos et al. (21) combine standard MR intensities with spectroscopy imaging to improve classification performance using three classification techniques.
In this study, we explore the heterogeneous regions of brain tumors by combining imaging features from several sequences and extract morphologic and texture characteristics. Our analysis requires three ROIs, which define the neoplastic and necrotic region on contrast enhanced T1-weighted MRI, and edematous region on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image. Instead of only measuring mean values in the ROIs, we investigate if conventional MRI has higher potential when complicated features are extracted, such as rotation invariant texture features based on Gabor filtering (22). Moreover, since it has been shown that contrast enhancement in conventional MRI is not sufficient for glioma grading or differentiating between metastasis and high grade tumor, we also incorporate rCBV maps. This approach incorporates imaging data which are (or can be) acquired in a routine clinical protocol, including multiparametric conventional MRI and perfusion.
We apply the method for binary classification, but also investigate the multiclass classification problem for differentiating between the most common brain tumors: metastasis, meningioma (usually grade I), low-grade glioma (grade II), grade III glioma, and glioblastoma (grade IV) according to the World Health Organization system. Grade II and grade III gliomas include astrocytomas (anaplastic or not), oligodendrogliomas, and oligoastrocytomas. The proposed framework consists of a training step, where the classifier learns the imaging characteristics of the different tumor types, and a testing step, where the classifier recognizes the tumor type in a new image. The framework is general and, if a significant number of observations (training samples) exist, can be applied to classify any other neoplasm and also non-neoplastic pathologies, including lymphoma, abscess, and encephalitis. We differentiate between tumor types by combining multiparametric MR images into a single classification rule rather than using single modalities independently. We exploit the potential of features extracted automatically from the images in order to avoid descriptive criteria, which are rater dependent and require prior knowledge (the help of experts).
The proposed scheme consists of four parts: ROI definition, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification based on SVMs. Leave-one-out cross-validation is used to test the robustness and accuracy of the proposed classification scheme.
