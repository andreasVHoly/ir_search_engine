1. Introduction
Artificial intelligence is the study of ways in
which computers can perform tasks that demand
intelligent behavior. Such tasks can be roughly divided
in two categories: task that can be solved by
commonsense reasoning and tasks that require expert
knowledge. Example tasks from the first category are
the understanding of stories or jokes written in natural
language, recognition of objects on photographs,
path finding in an environment with obstacles, and SO on. The second category comprises tasks such as
medical diagnostics, configuration of computer or
telecommunication systems, diagnostics of different
types of machinery, and so on. Ecological problems
that belong to this category include the task of
interpretation of biological or chemical samples of
river water, i.e., classification of river water quality.
For solving problems from the second category,
the methodology of expert systems was developed
within the area of artificial intelligence. Expert systems
are computer systems that can solve problems
in a narrow domain with a performance similar to
the one of human experts. The basic building blocks
of an expert system are a knowledge base, an inference engine, and a user interface (Harmon et al.,
1988). The user interface takes care of the communication
between the expert system and its user, including
the acquisition of the data needed to solve a
particular problem. The inference engine uses the
acquired data and the rules in the knowledge base to
infer intermediate and final conclusions regarding
the solution of the problem.
The key part of the expert system is the knowledge
base. While the other two parts of the expert
system (called an expert system shell) are interchangeable
across problem domains, the knowledge
base is specific to a particular problem domain. It
contains knowledge about that particular domain,
typically formulated as a set of IF-THEN rules,
which have an antecedent (IF) and a consequent
(THEN) part. These rules can be viewed as a model
of the domain studied, albeit in a form different from
the traditional differential equation models. A knowledge
base for an ecological domain can be regarded
as an ecological model.
A model in the form of equations can be derived
from expert knowledge and understanding of a particular
domain. A knowledge base in the form of
rules can be obtained in a similar manner. In the
practice of building expert systems, this turned out to
be a very difficult task. The construction of the
knowledge base was mostly done through a process
called knowledge acquisition (KA), during which a
knowledge engineer (computer expert) tried to extract
the knowledge from a domain expert (e.g.,
ecologist) by a permanent dialogue. This turned out
to be a difficult and frustrating process. Namely,
while experts perform their tasks with ease on particular
problems in the given domain, they find it very
difficult to describe how they do it precisely and in
detail. And even when they gave a description, it
often turned out that the description did not fit the
practice, i.e., what the expert said he was doing was
not what he was actually doing. This problem was so
acute that it got a name of its own - the knowledge
acquisition bottleneck.
A characteristic that defines a person as an expert
in a particular area is his ability to solve problems in
that area easily. Thus, examples of solved problems
are not difficult to come by. Machine learning, i.e.,as indicated in a previous paper in this series
(Kompare et al., 1994). From examples of solved
problems (e.g., biological samples and the corresponding
water quality classes), machine learning
tools can construct general rules that capture the
knowledge used to solve the problems. Such rules
can constitute a knowledge base for an expert system.
Expert systems of the second generation recognize
the usefulness of machine learning (ML) and
include ML tools, which can use examples of solved
problems and additional knowledge about the domain,
called deep knowledge. 
learning from examples, can thus be a useful tool in
constructing a knowledge base for an expert system,
