1. Introduction
Text categorization is the automatic assignment of one
or more predefined labels to free texts based on their content
[1–3]. Currently, the amount of the information that is
available on the web is increasing daily. The huge size of
the information makes the process of categorizing it manually
a very difficult task. Previously, some companies
and organizations had human experts in order to manipulate
these data, but now, this process is increasingly diffi-
cult. So, the trend of automatically categorize the data
has been introduced. Automatic categorization is used in
many fields, such as searching or filtering emails, digital
libraries, online databases, and online articles and news
[1,13,16].
Many methods, or classifiers, have been proposed in the
previous years. Examples are regression models [8,9], nearest
neighbor [10–14], decision trees [16,15,17] and support
vector machines [1]. Many studies have been conducted
on the performance of these classifiers based on English
articles. The most common source of data on these
researches was Reuters Newswire Corpus. However, for
Arabic data, the studies are limited in comparison to English
language.
The few examples that study the performance of automatic
classifiers on Arabic language can be found in [4–6].
In this paper, we studied both K Nearest Neighbor
(KNN) algorithm, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)
algorithm KNN and SVM classifiers, which are superior
on classifying English articles, and compared their performance
on Arabic articles. The performance measures that
we used are: recall, precision, and prediction time. We faced
a problem of finding a suitable corpus. As there is a lack of
publicly available Arabic corpus for evaluating Arabic text
categorization, we constructed our own corpus that is
extracted from the most common news papers. They are
called Alrai and Addustour newspapers. Our corpus is composed
of 2206 training articles and 29 testing articles. The
articles include two topics: Sport and Economy. Besides,
we used the common term-weighting tf.idf measure that is
used commonly to weight features. The tf.idf measure combines
the term frequency (tf) which measure the term density
in a document multiplied by the inverse document
frequency (idf) which is a measure of informativeness of a
term (its rarity across the whole corpus) [2,18,10]. Also,
we used the full word features from the corpus. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2
describes our methods of feature selection and dimensionality
reduction. Section 3 gives a short description of both
KNN and SVM classifiers. Section 4 describes our experimental
method and reports the experimental results.
Section 5 is a discussion, and Section 6 is a conclusion.

6. Conclusion
In this paper, we compared the performance of both
KNN and SVM classifiers on Arabic articles. Both classifi-
ers are superior in classifying Arabic articles. The SVM has
better Micro recall than KNN. The Micro precision values
of both classifiers are similar, with KNN a bit better. Micro
average F1 for both classifiers is high. When the number of
features is low, classifiers have similar performance, with
advantage given to SVM. But SVM outperforms KNN
clearly as the number of features increases. The prediction
time of SVM is better also than KNN.
The performance of both classifiers could be studied on
stemmed Arabic articles, and the results could be compared
with those obtained from Full word Arabic articles. Also,
the effect of the Arabic language sparsity on classifiers
could be studied in details. Finally, there should be a large
Arabic corpus that is used for research in order to give
more accurate results.
