As machine learning aims to address larger, more complex tasks, the problem of focusing on the most relevant information in a potentially overwhelming quantity of data has become increasingly important. For instance, data mining of corporate or scientific records often involves dealing with both many features and many examples, and the internet and World Wide Web have put a huge volume of low-quality information at the easy access of a learning system. Similar issues arise in the personalization of filtering systems for information retrieval, electronic mail, netnews, and the like. In this paper, we address two specific aspects of this “focusing” task that have received significant attention in the AI literature: the problem of focusing on the most relevant features for use in representing the data, and the problem of selecting the most relevant examples to drive the learning process. We review recent work on these topics, presenting general frameworks that we use to compare and contrast different approaches. We begin with the problem of focusing on relevant features. In Section 2 we present and relate several important notions of “relevance” for this task and describe some general goals of feature-selection algorithms. We report on methods that have been developed for this problem, characterizing them as “embedded”, “filter”, or “wrapper” approaches, and we compare explicit feature-selection techniques to those based on weighting schemes. We then turn (in Section 3) to the problem of focusing on relevant examples, describing methods for filtering both labeled and unlabeled data. We conclude (in Section 4) with open problems and challenges for future work, on both the empirical and theoretical fronts. Before proceeding, we should clarify the scope of our survey, which focuses on methods and results from computational learning theory and experimental machine learning. There has been substantial work on feature selection in other fields such as pattern recognition and statistics, and on data selection in fields such as statistics, information theory, and the philosophy of science. Although we do not have the space to cover the work in these areas, readers should be aware that there are many similarities to the approaches we will discuss.
