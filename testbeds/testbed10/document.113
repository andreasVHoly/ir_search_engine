Introduction The study of the potential distribution areas of species is a discipline of great interest to many researchers, due to the difficulty involved in establishing these areas in highly modified environments like Europe. Modelling of species distributions has become necessary in many aspects of biology, ecology and biogeography. Habitat suitability models could constitute a good tool for decision-making within the framework of applied biology. They have mainly been used 
in strategies for conservation, planning and forest management. In addition, habitat suitability models have recently aroused greater interest on being used for predicting the movement of species in the alternative impact scenarios that might be caused by the climate change predicted by the IPCC (Bakkenes et al., 2002; Pearson et al., 2002; Thuiller, 2003). They are also of evident scientific interest with regard to gleaning more in-depth knowledge about the differences existing between actual and potential species distribution areas. As a result of the efforts made in modelling habitat suitability, predictive techniques have become more numerous and have been improved in recent years (Guisan and Zimmerman, 2000), with a direct effect upon the quality and credibility of the models. Many different models are currently available. Among these, classical statistical models such as linear regression (Augustin et al., 2001), generalized linear models (Guisan et al., 1999), generalized additive models (Seoane et al., 2004; Luoto et al., 2005) and GRASP (generalized regression analysis and spatial prediction) (Lehmann et al., 2003), have been widely used. Also other approaches based on the delimitation of an hyperspace or envelope based on ecogeographical variables have been used for predicting habitat suitability. These models are known as environmental envelope models. Some of the most popular are BIOCLIM (Busby, 1991; Beamount et al., 2005), HABITAT (Walker and Cocks, 1991), DOMAIN (Carpenter et al., 1993) and ENFA (Hirtzel et al., 2002). Another kind of models are based on Bayesian inference (Fleishman et al., 2001; Ellison, 2004) for predicting species or communities distributions. Original approaches have also been used for specific problems such as the lack of absence data (Robertson et al., 2003; Hirtzel et al., 2002; Ottaviani et al., 2004; Phillips et al., 2006), or the use of phytosociological data as an input for prediction (Duckworth et al., 2000). In recent years, greater use has been made of machine learning methods, which comprise a series of non-parametric techniques capable of synthesising regression or classification functions based on available data. Machine learning methods present some advantages with respect to statistical methods: they are able to deal with complex relationships between predictors that can arise within large amounts of data, are able to process non-linear relationships between predictors and are able to process complex and noise data (Recknagel, 2001). The first techniques used for prediction of species distribution within machine learning methodology were classification and regression trees (Vayssiers et al., 2000; Debeljak et al., 2001; Miller and Franklin, ` 2002; Dzeroski and Drumm, 2003; Seoane et al., 2005 ˇ ), based on variants of the recursive partitioning CART model (Breiman et al., 1984). Later on, artificial neural networks were also utilized for building habitat suitability models (Lek and Guegan, 1999; Pearson et al., 2002; Dedecker et al., 2004), obtaining models that are complex superpositions of sigmoidal functions (Bishop, 1995). Recently, genetic algorithms (Peterson et al., 2002; Anderson et al., 2003; Dudik et al., 2004) have been used, based upon genetic and evolutionary models (Holland, 1975). In practice, the alternative predictive techniques do not produce the same distribution areas, with differences also depending on the species under study (Robertson et al., 2003; Thuiller, 2003; Segurado and Araujo, 2004). The modelling task therefore involves testing of several predictive techniques: if the study involves many species and a high spatial resolution, developing and comparing models may easily become complex and computationally challenging. Apart from the availability of a predictive technique adjusted to one’s specific needs, other factors that might help to improve the results obtained by the models should also be taken into consideration, such as the spatial resolution of the input data. This resolution depends very much on the geographic area being covered by the model. Studies for the whole of Europe generally regard a 50 km resolution (Bakkenes et al., 2002; Thuiller, 2003). Some regional studies have been developed at higher resolution, for example, for Portugal, at 10 km (Segurado and Araujo, 2004); for the United Kingdom, studies exist at resolutions of 5 and 1 km (Pearson et al., 2004). For the Iberian Peninsula, there are regional vegetation models for the North-East of Spain (Catalonia) with 1 km grids (Rouget et al., 2001; Thuiller et al., 2003). The Mediterranean basin is one of the areas with the highest level of plant diversity in Europe, partly due to the fact that it comprises a transition area to North African flora.Within the Mediterranean basin, some peninsulas are of particular interest, presenting a certain geographic isolation. In this study, we consider the Iberian Peninsula, one of the large-scale European hot-spots (Gomez-Campo and Malato-B ´ eliz, 1985 ´ ). The importance of this geographic region lies in the fact that it also served as a refuge to the migration of numerous European taxa during the glaciations (Hewitt, 1999). Furthermore, at present no potential vegetation model exists for the Iberian Peninsula, except for several intuitive approaches based upon the phytosociological interpretation of the vegetation series (Folch i Guillen, 1981; Rivas Mart ´ ´ınez, 1987; Loidi and Bascones, 1995).
