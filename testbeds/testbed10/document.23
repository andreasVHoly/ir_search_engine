Fuzzy classifiers (FCs) with if-then rules are related to the way human beings think and that is their main
advantage over black-box models, such as neural networks. Identification of FCs involves determining the
adequate structure and parameters. The structure identification consists of several tasks, such as, selecting
the adequate variables, assigning the adequate number of fuzzy sets to each variable and defining the number
of fuzzy rules used. In addition to that, the parameters of fuzzy sets need to be specified as well. It was illus- trated in [1], that such a task is highly complex due to its enormous search space, especially when high-dimensional problems are covered. Grid-type partitioning is a way to reduce the complexity of the identification problem. In that approach, the number of fuzzy sets assigned to each variable is fixed to some number and also the parameters of fuzzy sets are predefined. However that approach suffers from the curse of dimensionality, that is, the number of fuzzy rules is exponentially increased when the dimensionality of the problem is increased. To overcome that problem [2] applied grid-type partitioning with ‘‘don’t care’’ linguistic values and selected only the relevant rules out of the all possible rules. The benefit of the approach is its simple implementation, because it does not modify the parameters of fuzzy sets. Nevertheless, it was stated in [3] that fuzzy sets are the major components of FCs, since they affect the accuracy of the model, interpretability of fuzzy rules and also the performance of the system. It was stated in [2], that homogenously assigned fuzzy sets are intuitive, therefore making the FCs more interpretable. However, often they do not represent the real distribution of the data and therefore the accuracy of the obtained FCs is degraded [4,3]. Moreover, the intuitiveness of the linguistic values is also deteriorated. To tackle that problem, the fuzzy sets can also be pre-specified by domain experts. However, when dealing with high-dimensional problems, domain experts will have problems in assigning the fuzzy sets for each variable. Therefore automatic tuning of the fuzzy sets is usually required. Recently the goal in FC identification has been in obtaining accurate and interpretable FCs. Naturally accuracy and interpretability are conflicting objectives. For example, an FC with a vast rule-base may be accurate for training patterns, however, it lacks for interpretability and may not perform well on unseen samples due to the overfitting. Usually a trade-off between the accuracy and interpretability is sought using evolutionary algorithms (EAs) and often those approaches are called genetic fuzzy systems (GFS) [5]. A single trade-off solution can be found by aggregating multiple objectives (e.g. accuracy, number of rules and number of conditions) into a single fitness function and by setting the weights for each objective [6,7]. However, that requires work in choosing the appropriate weights, which may be different for each problem at hand. Moreover, it is not guaranteed that with every run a new solution is found [8]. Since multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) can find several widely spread Pareto-optimal solutions in a single run without assigning weight values for each objective, they are often preferred. After a set of solutions is obtained, advances and drawbacks of them can be considered and a solution can be selected based on the preferences. When EAs are applied, the population needs to be initialized first. That can be done randomly or manually like in [9–11]. Adequate initialization, however, can improve the convergence of EAs [12,13]. Hence, it is beneficial to use, for example, decision tree (DT) or clustering algorithms to initialize the population [14,6,15–17]. Furthermore, if variable selection is applied during the initialization and only the relevant variables are used to form the fuzzy rules, EAs need to search the appropriate rules and parameters of fuzzy sets only for the reduced set of variables. That clearly reduces the search space of EAs.
