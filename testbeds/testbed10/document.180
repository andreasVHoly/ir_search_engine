Reconciling Schemas of Disparate Data Sources:
A Machine-Learning Approach

1. INTRODUCTION
The increasing need of enterprises to uniformly access multiple sources of data and the rapid growth of structured
data available on the WWW have spurred considerable interest
in building data-integration systems (e.g., [8, 9, 24, 15,
11, 13]). Such a system provides users with a uniform interface
to a multitude of data sources, thus freeing them from
the details of the schemas of the sources and the particular
mode of interaction with each source. The system provides
this interface by enabling users to pose queries against a me- diated schema, which is a virtual schema that captures the
domain's salient aspects.
To answer queries, the data-integration system uses a set
of semantic mappings between the mediated schema and
the local schemas of the data sources. The system uses the mappings to reformulate a user query into a set of queries on
the data sources. Wrapper programs, attached to each data
source, handle the data formatting transformations between
the local data model and the data model in the integration
system. Figure 1 illustrates a data-integration system that
helps users end houses on the real-estate market.
A key bottleneck in building data-integration systems is
the acquisition of semantic mappings. Today these mappings
are provided manually by the builders of the system,
resulting in a laborious and error-prone process. The emergence
of XML as a standard syntax for sharing data among
sources further fuels data sharing applications, and hence
underscores the need to develop methods for acquiring se- mantic mappings. Clearly, while the task of ending semantic
mappings cannot be fully automated, the development
of tools for assisting the process is crucial to truly achieve
large-scale data integration.
In this paper we describe the LSD (Learning Source Descriptions)
system that uses and extends machine learning
techniques to semi-automatically create semantic mappings.
Throughout the discussion, we shall assume that the
sources present their data in XML, and that the mediatedand
source schemas are represented with DTDs. Then, the
schema-matching problem is toe nd correspondences among
the elements of the mediated schema and the source DTDs.
The key idea underlying our approach is that after a small
set of data sources have been manually mapped to the mediated
schema, LSD should be able to glean signifcant information
from these mappings to successfully propose mappings
for subsequent data sources.

9. CONCLUSIONS & FUTURE WORK
We have described an approach to schema matching that
employs and extends machine learning techniques. Our approach
utilizes both schema and data from the sources. To match a source-schema element, the system applies a set of
learners, each of which looks at the problem from a different
perspective, then combines the learners' predictions using
a meta-learner. The meta-learner's predictions are further
improved using domain constraints and user feedback. We also developed a novel XML learner that exploits the hierar-
