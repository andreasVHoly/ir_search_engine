1. Introduction The classification of land use and land cover (LULC) from remotely sensed imagery can be divided into two general image analysis approaches: i) classifications based on pixels, and ii) classifications based on objects. While pixel-based analysis has long been the mainstay approach for classifying remotely sensed imagery, object-based image analysis has become increasingly commonplace over the last decade (Blaschke, 2010). Whether pixels or objects are used as underlying units for the purposes of classifying remotely derived imagery, the information contained within - and among - these units (e.g., spectral, textural, etc.) can be subjected to a variety of classifi- cation algorithms. Previous comparative studies have been conducted that examine the relative performance of different classification algorithms using pixel-based, and/or object-based image analysis. A brief summary of selected comparisons is provided below.

Using pixel-based based image analysis on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data, Huang et al. (2002) compared thematic mapping accuracies produced using four different classification algorithms: support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees (DTs), a neural network classi- fier, and the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC). Their results suggested that the accuracy of SVM-based classifications generally outperformed the other three classification algorithms. Pal (2005) compared the accuracies of two supervised classification algorithms using Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data: SVMs and Random Forests (RFs) (Breiman, 2001), and found that they performed equally well. Gislason et al. (2006) compared a RF approach to a variety of decision tree-like algorithms using pixel-based image analysis of Landsat MSS data. They found that the selected tree-like algorithms tested performed similarly, but that the RF algorithm outperformed the standard implementation of Breiman et al.'s (1984) DTs;
