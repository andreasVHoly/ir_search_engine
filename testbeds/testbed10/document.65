Recently, advances in single-trial EEG-analysis have achieved the efficient online differentiation of neuroelectric signals. The present contribution distinguishes between two main application fields of these analysis techniques: (a) brain–computer interfacing and (b) online monitoring of brain states. This paper reviews both along with the machine learning and signal analysis machinery that is necessary for such online EEG processing. Brain–computer interfaces (BCI) allow for communication that is solely based on brain signals, independent from muscles or peripheral nerves (seeWolpaw et al., 2002; Kubler et al., 2001; ¨ Curran and Stokes, 2003; Kubler and M ¨ uller, 2007; Dornhege ¨ et al., 2007a; Carmena et al., 2003 for a broader overview and background information). The Berlin brain–computer interface (BBCI) is a non-invasive, EEG-based system whose key features are (1) the use of motor imagery for control tasks, (2) advanced machine learning techniques that automatically extract complex high-dimensional features and classify in a robust manner, and – as a consequence – (3) no need for subject training. The latter characteristic is considered an important contribution since typical BCI systems rely on classical conditioning (cf. Elbert et al., 1980; Rockstroh et al., 1984; Birbaumer et al., 2000) and require extensive subject training of 50–100 h.1 In contrast, the BBCI approach allows to shift the training effort from the user towards the machine (cf. Section 3). Section 4.1 will demonstrate a BBCI application: the Hex-o-Spell interface for spelling. Brain–computer interfacing is certainly not the only interesting application when decoding brain activity. General online monitoring of generic brain states beyond voluntarily altered brain activity has in the past been under study, e.g. for the detection of sleep stages, tiredness, arousal, for emotion monitoring and for cognitive workload analysis (Kohlmorgen et al., 2007; Haynes and Rees, 2006; Muller et al., 1995) ¨ . In Section 4.3 the real-time monitoring of mental states using EEG are discussed and the example of monitoring a subject’s arousal to estimate it’s concentration ability within an industrial problem setting is briefly outlined.
