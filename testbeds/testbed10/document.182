1.0 Introduction
In recent years there has been a significant increase in
research on automatic image recognition in more realistic
contexts involving noise, changing lighting conditions,
and shifting viewpoints. The corresponding increase in
dfficulty in designing effective classifkation procedures for
the important components of these more complex
recognition problems has led to an interest in machine
techniques as a possible strategy for automatically
producing classification rules. This paper describes part of
a larger effort to apply machine learning techniques to such
problems in an attempt to generate and improve the
classification rules required for various recognition tasks.
The immediate problem attacked is that of texture
recognition in the context of noise and changing lighting
conditions. In this context standard rule induction systems
like AQl5 produce sets of classification rules which are
sub-optimal in two respects. First, there is a need to
minimize the number of features actually used for
classification, since each feature used adds to the design and
manufacturing costs as well as the running time of a
recognition system. At the same time there is a need to
achieve high recognition rates in the presence of noise and
changing environmental conditions.
This paper describes an approach being explored to
improve the usefulness of machine learning techniques for
such problems. The approach described here involves the
use of genetic algorithms as a "front end" to traditional rule
induction systems in order to identify and select the best
subset of features to be used by the rule induction system.
The results presented suggest that genetic algorithms are a
useful tool for solving difficult feature selection problems in which both the size of the feature set and the
performance of the underlying system are important design
considerations. 

6.0 Summary and Conclusions
The experimental results obtained indicate the potential
advantages of using feature selection techniques to improve
rule induction techniques. The reported results indicate that
an adaptive feature selection strategy using genetic
algorithms can yield a significant reduction in the number
of features required for texture classification and
simultaneously produce improvements in recognition rates
of the rules produced by AQ15. This is a step towards the
application of machine leaming techniques for automating
the of constructing classification systems for difficult
image processing problems.
