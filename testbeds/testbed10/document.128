Mining Big Data: Current Status, and Forecast to the
Future

1. INTRODUCTION
Recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase in our ability
to collect data from various sensors, devices, in different
formats, from independent or connected applications. This
data flood has outpaced our capability to process, analyze,
store and understand these datasets. Consider the Internet
data. The web pages indexed by Google were around one
million in 1998, but quickly reached 1 billion in 2000 and
have already exceeded 1 trillion in 2008. This rapid expansion
is accelerated by the dramatic increase in acceptance of
social networking applications, such as Facebook, Twitter,
Weibo, etc., that allow users to create content freely and
amplify the already huge Web volume. Furthermore, with
mobile phones becoming the sensory gateway to get realtime
data on people from different aspects, the vast amount
of data that mobile carriers can potentially process to improve
our daily life has significantly outpaced our past CDR
(call data record)-based processing designed only for billing
purposes. It can be foreseen that Internet of things (IoT)
applications will raise the scale of data to an unprecedented
level. People and devices (from home coffee machines to
cars, to buses, railway stations and airports) are all loosely
connected. Trillions of such connected components will generate
a huge data ocean, and valuable information must be
discovered from the data to help improve quality of life and
make our world a better place. For example, after we get up
every morning, in order to optimize our commute time to
work and complete the optimization before we arrive at the
office, the system needs to process information from traffic, weather, construction, police activities to our calendar
schedules, and perform deep optimization under tight time
constraints. In all these applications, we are facing significant
challenges in leveraging the vast amount of data, including
challenges in (1) system capabilities (2) algorithmic
design (3) business models.
As an example of the interest that Big Data is having in
the data mining community, the grand theme of this year’s
KDD conference was “Mining the Big Data”. Also there
was a specific workshop BigMine’12 in that theme: 1st International
Workshop on Big Data, Streams and Heterogeneous
Source Mining: Algorithms, Systems, Programming
Models and Applications1. Both events successfully brought
together people from both academia and industry to present
their most recent work related to these Big Data issues, and
exchange ideas and thoughts. These events are important
in order to advance this Big Data challenge, which is being
considered as one of the most exciting opportunities in the
years to come.
We introduce Big Data mining and its applications in Section
2. We summarize the papers presented in this issue in
Section 3, and discuss Big Data controversy in Section 4. We
stress the importance of open-source software tools in Section
5 and give some challenges and forecast to the future
in Section 6. Finally, we give some conclusions in Section 7.


7. CONCLUSIONS
Big Data is going to continue growing over the years to come,
and each data scientist will have to manage a much larger
amount of data every year. This data is going to be more
diverse, larger, and faster. We discussed in this paper some
insights about the topic, and what we consider are the main
concerns, and the main challenges for the future. Big Data is
becoming the new Final Frontier for scientific data research
and for business applications. We are at the beginning of
a new era where Big Data mining will help us to discover
knowledge that no one has discovered before. Everybody is
warmly invited to participate in this intrepid journey
