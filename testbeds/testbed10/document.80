The development of models for structure-actiVity relationships (SARs) has a long and successful history in medicinal chemistry, but applications of SAR techniques for toxicological effects are still rather sparse. Although the objectives, the prediction of biological activities from chemical structures, are closely related, there are fundamental differences between both application areas. SAR studies in pharmaceutical research rely typically on a few (several tens to hundreds) compounds, containing a basic structure responsible for activity (i.e. they are congeneric). Variations in activity are caused by secondary features (e.g. presence, length or composition of certain side-chains). In many cases the cellular target (e.g. receptor, active site of an enzyme) is known, and some information about biological mechanisms is also available. Based on this knowledge it is possible to select a limited set of descriptors for the chemical structures, which might be relevant for the activities of the investigated compounds. The situation is much more complicated for the majority of toxic effects: Many different molecular mechanisms and cellular targets may be involved in a single toxic effect. As a consequence, chemicals with very different structures (noncongenerics) may cause the same toxicological effect. With such a limited amount of information, the selection of appropriate descriptors for SAR studies is more or less a trial and error process.1 In addition many toxicity assays are rather time-consuming and expensive, especially those which are considered to have the highest relevance for human health (e.g. in vivo experiments). Under these circumstances it is in most cases impossible to perform experiments especially for SAR studies. Therefore SAR models have to use existing databases, where the composition and distribution of structures and activities is far from optimal, because they have been selected according to different criteria (e.g. production volumes, results from short-term tests). Under these conditions the identification of a toxicological structure-activity relationship is essentially a data mining problem: The researcher has to identify regularities within the chemical structures and their toxic activities that allow the construction of a model that predicts the activity of untested compounds. More specifically, the data mining task can be decomposed into two steps: 1. Generation of descriptors for the chemical structures 2. Induction of the SAR model In the present paper, the use of various data mining techniques2 for both steps is systematically explored on a database of mutagenic activities. The goal is to obtain insight into the utility of such data mining techniques for building SARs from toxicological databases. Among the data mining techniques selected, special attention was given to symbolic machine learning techniques, because they are able to derive understandable and interpretable models. It is therefore possible to use the induced models for predictive as well as for explanatory purposes (i.e. to identify structural features that may cause a certain toxic effect). In particular we have investigated the following: • the utility of a newly developed system for the generation of molecular substructures (MOLFEA3,4) as compared to molecular properties calculated by various computational chemistry programs, • the suitability of various machine learning programs for the generation of mutagenicity SARs from the descriptors mentioned before and • the optimization of parameters for these programs, to identify the optimal conditions for the detection of mutagenicity SARs within data sets with noncongeneric compounds.
