Modern tomographic imaging methods are playing an increasingly important role in understanding brain structure and function, as well as in understanding the way in which these change during development, aging and pathology (Davatzikos and Resnick, 2002; Giedd et al., 1999; Resnick et al., 2003; Shen

et al., 2001; Sowell et al., 2002). Information obtained through the analysis of brain images can be used to explain anatomical differences between normal and pathologic populations, as well as to potentially help in the early diagnosis of pathology (Arenillas et al., 2002). For example, subtle patterns of brain atrophy and changes in brain physiology in individuals with no clinical symptoms could prove to be early predictors of the development of dementia (Brown et al., 2001; Hyman, 1997; Weiner et al., 2001). Interventions at early stages of a disease are often more effective than at later stages (Lamar et al., 2003). Therefore, developing methods for early diagnosis of subtle anatomical and physiological characteristics of individuals at high risk for disease are becoming increasingly important, as pharmaceutical interventions are being developed concurrently. Brain diseases, including Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD), introduce tissue loss that is believed to be regionally specific (Bobinski et al., 1999; Braak et al., 1998; Csernansky et al., 2000; DeLeon et al., 1991; deToledo-Morrell et al., 1997; Freeborough and Fox, 1998; Golomb et al., 1993; Gomez-Isla et al., 1996; Hyman et al., 1984; Jobst et al., 1994; Thompson et al., 2001). Such spatial patterns of atrophy are confounded by atrophy due to normal aging (Resnick et al., 2000; Sullivan et al., 2002), which also occurs in patients along with additional pathological processes. Although functional changes can often be identified early in the disease process (Morris et al., 1989), different pathologies can result in similar functional changes, making differential diagnosis and treatment decisions difficult. Moreover, imaging-based structural measurements of the medial temporal lobe have been shown to increase predictive accuracy for clinical outcomes above that of cognitive dysfunction (Visser et al., 2002). Several groups have also shown that temporal lobe measurements predict AD in patients with mild cognitive impairment (Jack et al., 1989; Killiany et al., 2000). These brain changes are being explored as possible surrogate markers of therapeutic efficacy of potential treatments to stop the progression of AD. Therefore, more advanced methods of morphometric analysis could potentially help diagnose the disease even earlier, before measurable functional loss occurs and at a stage in which treatment might be more effective, and may help monitor the efficacy of interventions in clinical trials. Similar challenges to those understanding and diagnosing dementia are faced in many other brain diseases.

For example, despite its devastating impact, schizophrenia affects the brain structure in a rather subtle way, and is difficult to reliably detect or precisely characterize in the presence of interindividual morphological variability (Haller et al., 1996). To develop an accurate predictor of pathology from a set of volumetric images, two issues need to be addressed. First, an image analysis methodology needs to extract the most relevant information from the images. Second, this information needs to be supplied to a pattern classification method that determines whether the image information implies a high likelihood of the development of disease. Although these two issues are rather new to the neuroimaging field, they are standard problems that have been studied extensively in the computer vision and pattern recognition literatures. However, there are unique characteristics to this problem that pose new challenges. In particular, the high dimensionality of volumetric brain images, the complexity of brain anatomy and inter-individual variability are a few of these challenges. One of the traditional ways of analyzing brain images is based on the definition of regions of interest (ROIs) according to some a priori hypothesis, and statistically analyzing the volumes of these ROIs. This approach is limited in that a good a priori hypothesis must be formed before meaningful measurements can be obtained. Although this is sometimes possible, in general, it limits the ability of a study to identify new and previously unexplored relationships between structural changes and disease. Moreover, manual definition of ROIs often suffers from low repeatability as it is cumbersome and therefore not practical for large-scale investigations. A new class of methods for morphological analysis of brain images has emerged during the past decade which is based on voxel-wise measurements, with no a priori hypothesis (Ashburner et al., in press; Csernansky et al., 2000; Davatzikos et al., 1996, 2001; Freeborough and Fox, 1998; Good et al., 2002; Sowell et al., 1999a,b; Thompson et al., 2001). The statistics of a morphological variable are determined for a normal population and are compared against individual measurements or group statistics of another population (e.g., one with a particular disease). Voxels that differ from the normal population are flagged and grouped into clusters reflecting pathology. A fundamental limitation of this kind of approach is that voxel-wise statistical comparisons have limited power to identify subtle differences between two populations, as is often the case in practice. This means that morphological measurements considered individually on each voxel tend to display great overlap across different populations, thereby rendering classification impossible. However, if one considers the collection of morphological measurements over the entire brain, very powerful and sensitive classifiers can be developed (Miller et al., 1997). We describe such a method in this paper. Intuitively speaking, if one were to zoom into an individual voxel in the brain and try to determine whether that voxel is abnormal, the examiner would be challenged, unless information from the vicinity of that voxel, from the opposite hemisphere, or from other brain regions is also presented to the rater. In our approach we use the entire set of morphometric measurements obtained from every single voxel in the brain simultaneously, and build a high-dimensional morphological classifier from them. In the following section we describe in detail the set of measurements that is extracted from the images and the classifier that is trained on many pre-classified training samples.
