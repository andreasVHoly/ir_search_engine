1. Introduction
Discovering knowledge in large amounts of data collected over the last decades has become significantly challenging and
difficult, especially in large-scale databases. Data mining (DM) [60] involves the use of data analysis tools to discover
previously unknown, valid patterns and relationships in large data sets. Classification and regression are two forms of data
analysis which can be used to extract models describing important data classes or to predict future data trends. Classification
predicts categorical labels whereas regression models predict continuous-valued functions.
The data analysis tools used for DM include statistical models, mathematical methods, and machine learning algorithms.
Classification is a common task in supervised machine learning with the search for algorithms that learn from training
examples to produce predictions about future examples.
Classification has been successfully solved using several approaches [26]. On the one hand, there are approaches such as
artificial neural networks (ANN) [46], support vector machines (SVM) [16], and instance-based learning methods [2]. These
approaches obtain accurate classification models but they must be regarded as black boxes, i.e., they are opaque to the user.
Opaque predictive models prevent the user from tracing the logic behind a prediction and obtaining interesting knowledge
previously unknown from the model. These classifiers do not permit human understanding and inspection, they are not
directly interpretable by an expert and it is not possible to discover which are the relevant attributes to predict the class
of an example. This opacity prevents them from being used in many real-life knowledge discovery applications where both
accuracy and comprehensibility are required, such as medical diagnosis [55], credit risk evaluation [42], and decision support
systems [6], since the prediction model must explain the reasons for 6. Conclusion
In this paper we have proposed an interpretable classification rule mining (ICRM) algorithm, which is an interpretable
and efficient rule-based evolutionary programming classification algorithm. The algorithm solves the cooperation–competition
problem by dealing with the interaction among the rules during the evolutionary process. The proposal minimizes the
number of rules, the number of conditions per rule, and the number of conditions of the classifier, increasing the interpretability
of the solutions. The algorithm does not explore already explored search spaces. Once one rule has no better conditions
to be appended, the rule is marked as unbeatable and no more searches are performed over that rule, saving
computational resources. Moreover, the algorithm stops when all the individuals are marked as unbeatable, i.e., there is
no possibility of improving any individual, saving further generations. The population size and the maximum number of generations
are equal to the number of features. Thus, it is not necessary to configure or optimize these parameters; it is selfadapting
to the problem complexity. classification.
