1. Introduction
“The Holy Grail of (digital) change detection is still total automation and high accuracy.” (Loveland et al., 2002, p. 1098). Over the coming decades, the global effects of land-cover/use change may be as significant, or more so, than those associated with potential climate change (IPCC, 2000). In spite of this there is a lack of comprehensive information on the types and rates of land-cover/use change, and even less evidence of natural and anthropogenic causes and consequences of such change (Turner et al., 1999). As a result, several large area land-cover monitoring programs have been established over the past five years to comprehensively address this issue (Wulder et al., 2004). Monitoring programs, unlike most research-oriented studies, employ change mapping methods that require processing and interpretation of large volumes of in situ, remotely sensed and ancillary data ( Cihlar, 2000 and Franklin and Wulder, 2002). Very large data volumes and time-consuming data processing, integration and interpretation make automated and accurate methods of change mapping highly desirable ( Aspinall, 2002, Dobson and Bright, 1994, Hansen et al., 2002 and Rogan and Chen, 2004).

Complex land change processes are of particular interest to researchers involved in large area monitoring (Roberts et al., 2002), where many different types of land-cover changes can occur and must be characterized (e.g., forest pest infestation, logging, wildfire, and suburbanization) (Rogan & Miller 2006). Thus, increased automation can ensure that the classification process is objective and repeatable in processing large volumes of data over complex and phenologically diverse landscapes (DeFries and Chan, 2000 and Gong and Xu, 2003). Consequently, classification algorithm selection and performance have become particularly important, because large area change monitoring can only realistically be achieved (i.e., low cost and generalizable results) through techniques that minimize time-consuming human interpretation and maximize automated procedures for data analysis (Woodcock et al., 2001).

A wide variety of classification algorithms have been used to map land-cover/use and changes to land-cover/use, from remotely sensed data. Unsupervised classification and cluster labeling is the dominant method for large area land-cover mapping and monitoring (see Wulder et al., 2004). Recently, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) have emerged as more accurate and efficient alternatives to conventional parametric algorithms (e.g., maximum likelihood), when faced with large data volumes and complex measurement spaces (Foody, 1995, Muchoney and Williamson, 2001 and Kasischke et al., 2004). The effectiveness of MLAs has been demonstrated primarily in single-date land-cover mapping studies (Friedl et al., 1999 and Pal and Mather, 2003). However, their effectiveness in change mapping has also recently been addressed (Gopal and Woodcock, 1996, Liu and Lathrop, 2002 and Chan and Chan, 2002).

The objective of this research was to compare the performance of three MLAs; two classification tree software routines (S-Plus and C4.5) and an artificial neural network (ARTMAP), in the context of mapping land-cover modifications in southern and northern California between 1990/91 and 1996. These algorithms were specifically chosen because they are increasingly used in land-cover mapping and monitoring using medium-coarse spatial resolution remotely sensed data (Rogan & Chen 2004), yet have not been compared with each other in a large area, large data volume context. This study is based on the US Forest Service and California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection statewide land-cover mapping and monitoring program (LCMMP) in California. LCMMP personnel required an evaluation of available machine learning algorithms to determine the feasibility of automating their land-cover change detection procedures. The current LCMMP is based on time-consuming unsupervised classification and cluster labeling (Levien et al., 1999).

Algorithm comparison followed two steps. Step one assessed how algorithm performance was affected by modifications in the model data. Performance was assessed using classification accuracy measures and the model data set was modified to test the following: (1) effect of partitioning data sets; (2) effect of training data set size; and (3) the effect of training data errors (i.e., noise). Step two compared a map of land-cover change, generated using the algorithm deemed best overall from step one, to a map produced by the LCMMP that was created through unsupervised classification and cluster labeling by human interpreters. The results of this work are intended to inform the growing number of resource managers engaged in other operational land-cover monitoring projects.

Conclusion 

Remote sensing-based mapping and monitoring of large areas has created new challenges for the remote sensing and land change science communities. The spatial scale and data volumes of large area change monitoring dictate the need for classification algorithms that minimize requirements for human intervention and promote automated classification. Attempts to solve these challenges have led researchers away from accepted and well-understood parametric algorithms, such as maximum likelihood, to newer non-parametric algorithms that offer increased accuracy and performance over large areas and data volumes. At the same time, these algorithms are less understood in the remote sensing context, particularly in land-cover change mapping. To address this issue, this study provided insights toward improved understanding of non-parametric algorithms for large area change mapping and found the ARTMAP neural network classifier to be most robust and accurate in mapping land-cover modifications within southern and northern California study areas. The supervised classification approach developed in this paper can potentially allow for the rapid re-mapping of the same study area at a different time period using (a) high quality ground reference data and (b) a robust classification algorithm.
