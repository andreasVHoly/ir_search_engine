Motivation. The UMLS has been used in natural language processing applications such as information retrieval and information extraction systems. The mapping of free-text to UMLS concepts is important for these applications. To improve the mapping, we need a method to disambiguate terms that possess multiple UMLS concepts. In the general English domain, machine-learning techniques have been applied to sense-tagged corpora, in which senses (or concepts) of ambiguous terms have been annotated (mostly manually). Sense disambiguation classifiers are then derived to determine senses (or concepts) of those ambiguous terms automatically. However, manual annotation of a corpus is an expensive task. We propose an automatic method that constructs sense-tagged corpora for ambiguous terms in the UMLS using MEDLINE abstracts.

Conclusions. UMLS conceptual relations and MEDLINE abstracts can be used to automatically acquire knowledge needed for resolving ambiguity when mapping free-text to UMLS concepts.
With the widespread use of computers in the biomedical domain, a vast, rich range of biomedical data, including coded data, as well as free-text data has been stored in digital format. Computer applications can interpret coded data automatically while free-text data pose challenges to system developers. To enable access to free text in the biomedical domain, natural language processing (NLP) systems have been developed that facilitate information retrieval (IR), information extraction (IE), and text mining on free text.1–3 However, all NLP systems require identification of terms (a term can be a single word or a multi-word phrase) in free text with entries in a lexical table.3,4 Terms in free text can be ambiguous and may have multiple unrelated senses in the lexical table. For example, capsule in discharge summaries can mean a unit for a medication, such as in “He was put on Dyazide one capsule daily over the past two days” or a body region, such as in “There may be faint lucency in the left internal capsule.” It may have related senses, such as the chemical term potassium, which can mean a laboratory test item in “Her potassium had been as low as 2.7 on July 27” or a drug item in “Her discharge medications are digoxin five days a week and potassium supplements 10 mEq each week day.” It can also be an abbreviation that has multiple full forms, or that has the same spelling as a general English word, such as HR, which denotes hour or heart rate, and SOB, which denotes short of breath as well as the general English wordsob. Resolving the ambiguity of ambiguous terms is a case of word sense disambiguation (WSD). In the general English domain, some WSD systems resolve ambiguity caused by entries in machine-readable dictionaries that have multiple senses. Note that entries in machine-readable dictionaries can be phrases as well as words.
