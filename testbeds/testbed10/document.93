1. Introduction The automated recognition of gait change has attracted much attention in view of its advantages in medical diagnostics as well as in the early identification of at-risk gait in the elderly. Automatic gait recognition has been pursued using traditional statistical modeling techniques such as artificial neural network (ANN). For example, Barton and Lees (1997) employed ANN to discriminate simulated gait patterns using hip–knee joint angle data. Holzreiter and Kohle (1993) applied ANN to recognize normal and pathological gait using foot-ground reaction force data. Recently, with the advent of machine learning theory, a wide variety of novel learning and classification algorithms has emerged. In particular, Support Vector Machine (SVM) – a powerful technique for solving classification problems with superior performance – has been successfully applied in gait recognition. Begg and Kamruzzaman (2005) demonstrated the suitability of SVM in gait classification, i.e., the distinction of young–old gait patterns on the basis of spatio-temporal, kinematic, and kinetic data. They obtained a good performance even when the number of gait data available for developing the model was limited (i.e., small size sample gait data). However, as the authors only used a group of 24 gait variables extracted from curve and single value data as SVM inputs, they ignored the fact that adequate pre-processing methods for extracting valuable information from input variables are essential for good generalization of machine classifier systems. As we know, the gait data to be classified by classification algorithms are represented as points in a multidimensional feature space, and additional vector space transformations are usually applied on the initial gait features prior to employing a learning algorithm (Kocsor & To´th, 2004). The reason for doing this is that a given set of gait data often comprises different kinds of components such as kinematic, kinetic, electromyographic (EMG), metabolic and anthropometric variables. Moreover, additionally derived gait parameters, such as joint angles, velocities, moments and powers (i.e., by using inverse dynamics) may provide useful information about human movement (Chau, 2001a). Hence, pre-processing for extracting specific gait features (i.e., the transformation of the initial gait feature set into another one) is the first important step for improving classification performance. The transformation in question is not only capable of extracting good gait features (i.e., reduce the dimensionality of the gait data), but can also provide additional discriminative information for improving classification performance. Linear principal component analysis (PCA), the most popular technique for this purpose, yields a set of orthogonal bases that capture the directions of maximum variance in the training data, and the uncorrelated expansion coefficients in the new bases (Turk & Pentland, 1991; Xie & Lam, 2006). Consequently, PCA has been successfully applied in the field of gait analysis for the purpose of reducing redundant information, as well as for interpreting multiple gait signals. Daffertshofer, Lamoth, Meijer, and Beek (2004) highlighted the application of PCA in studying coordination and variability in human movement. Troje (2002) showed that PCA can be applied to obtain more information about human gait patterns. Olney, Griffin, and McBride (1998) applied PCA to 74 gait variables (spatio-temporal, kinematic and kinetic parameters) recorded from 31 stroke patients in order to reduce redundant information. However, because linear PCA is based on second-order correlations between data, it can only capture the information explicitly provided in the training data. It is well known that gait variables usually interact in a complex, nonlinear fashion as a consequence of the intrinsically nonlinear dynamics of human movement (Chau,2001a; Wagenaar & Van Emmerik, 1996), and that, therefore, all the ‘interesting’ gait characteristics cannot be described by second-order correlations (Chau, 2001b). This motivates the use of a nonlinear analysis technique that can capture the nonlinear structure of human gait patterns. Consistent with Cover’s theorem, it has been shown that nonlinearly separable patterns in an input space may be transformed such that they are linearly separable in a higher-dimensional feature space via a nonlinear mapping (Haykin, 1999; Xie & Lam, 2006). In general, such a mapping is achieved by means of a kernel function (Scholkopf & Smola, 2002). Thus, the gait data are first mapped into a higher-dimensional feature space through a kernel function, to then apply linear PCA methods in order to extract gait features in the transformed space corresponding to nonlinear feature extraction in the input space. Consequently, kernel-based PCA (KPCA) may uncover the nonlinear structure of gait data, and offer significant information for gait classification. In the present study, we evaluated the use of KPCA to extract more gait features in order to improve the classification of gait patterns. That is, we applied kernel-based feature extraction methods prior to learning in order to improve classification performance (Kocsor & To´th, 2004). To this end, we defined each gait pattern to consist of 36 discrete measurement values (spatio-temporal, kinematic parameters) that we obtained from 24 young and 24 elderly participants during a gait cycle. First, nonlinear gait features were extracted by means of KPCA to then evaluate its effect on a subsequent classification in combination with learning algorithms such as support vector machines (Kocsor & To´th, 2004). Furthermore, to examine whether the combination of KPCA and SVM produces a superior classification performance than other gait classifier systems, we also compared the classification performance of KPCA-based SVM with those of PCA-based SVM and original SVM (i.e., without feature extraction from input gait variables). The present article is organized as follows. In Section 2, the method of using KPCA for gait feature extraction is described, followed by a brief explanation of the use of SVM for gait classification in Section 3. Section 4 explains the experimental procedure for evaluating the performance of the proposed technique, while Section 5 presents the experimental results. Finally, discussions and conclusions are provided in Sections 6 and 7, respectively.

7. Conclusions

In this study, we examined the KPCA technique, which can overcome the defects of traditional feature extraction algorithms, in extracting the nonlinear characteristics of gait data in a high-dimensional space. Furthermore, combining KPCA with SVM can classify young–old gait patterns with superior performance. The results of this research demonstrate that with our gait data, the proposed technique is able to efficiently extract nonlinear gait features for automatic classification of health young or elderly gait patterns with higher accuracy, and carries considerable potential for future applications in clinical circumstances. For utilizing our method in clinical circumstances as pre-diagnosing of gait diseases and evaluating the outcome of treatment and rehabilitation, more effort should be exerted to evaluate the technique by selecting the different types of gait parameters such as kinetic and electromyography gait data, to further validate the proposed technique by making comparisons to pathological participants, and to examine direct dimensionality reduction and interpretation of multiple gait signals for the assistance of the clinical evaluation
