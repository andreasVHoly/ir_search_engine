Thumbs up? Sentiment Classification using Machine Learning
Techniques

1 Introduction
Today, very large amounts of information are available
in on-line documents. As part of the effort to
better organize this information for users, researchers
have been actively investigating the problem of automatic
text categorization.
The bulk of such work has focused on topical categorization,
attempting to sort documents according
to their subject matter (e.g., sports vs. politics).
However, recent years have seen rapid growth
in on-line discussion groups and review sites (e.g.,
the New York Times’ Books web page) where a crucial
characteristic of the posted articles is their sentiment,
or overall opinion towards the subject matter
— for example, whether a product review is positive
or negative. Labeling these articles with their
sentiment would provide succinct summaries to readers;
indeed, these labels are part of the appeal and
value-add of such sites as www.rottentomatoes.com,
which both labels movie reviews that do not contain
explicit rating indicators and normalizes the
different rating schemes that individual reviewers use. Sentiment classification would also be helpful in
business intelligence applications (e.g. MindfulEye’s
Lexant system1
) and recommender systems (e.g.,
Terveen et al. (1997), Tatemura (2000)), where user
input and feedback could be quickly summarized; indeed,
in general, free-form survey responses given in
natural language format could be processed using
sentiment categorization. Moreover, there are also
potential applications to message filtering; for example,
one might be able to use sentiment information
to recognize and discard “flames”(Spertus, 1997).
In this paper, we examine the effectiveness of applying
machine learning techniques to the sentiment
classification problem. A challenging aspect of this
problem that seems to distinguish it from traditional
topic-based classification is that while topics are often
identifiable by keywords alone, sentiment can be
expressed in a more subtle manner. For example, the
sentence “How could anyone sit through this movie?”
contains no single word that is obviously negative.
(See Section 7 for more examples). Thus, sentiment
seems to require more understanding than the usual
topic-based classification. So, apart from presenting
our results obtained via machine learning techniques,
we also analyze the problem to gain a better understanding
of how difficult it is.

7 Discussion
The results produced via machine learning techniques
are quite good in comparison to the humangenerated
baselines discussed in Section 4. In terms
of relative performance, Naive Bayes tends to do the
worst and SVMs tend to do the best, although theniques than our positional feature mentioned above),
or at least some way of determining the focus of each
sentence, so that one can decide when the author is
talking about the film itself. (Turney (2002) makes
a similar point, noting that for reviews, “the whole
is not necessarily the sum of the parts”.) Furthermore,
it seems likely that this thwarted-expectations
rhetorical device will appear in many types of texts
(e.g., editorials) devoted to expressing an overall
opinion about some topic. Hence, we believe that an
important next step is the identification of features
indicating whether sentences are on-topic (which is
a kind of co-reference problem); we look forward to
addressing this challenge in future work.
