MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (∼22 nt) RNA molecules that either mark their target mRNAs for degradation or suppress their translation by binding to the 3′-untranslated region (3′UTR). Previous studies have suggested that the miRNA seed segment (Fig. 1) that includes 6–8 nt at the 5′ end of the mature miRNA sequence is very important in the selection of the target site. Thus most of the computational tools developed to identify mRNA target sequences depend heavily on the complementarity with the ‘seed’ sequence in the target. However, Brennecke et al. (2005) have recently suggested that the 3′ out-seed segment of the miRNA:mRNA duplex sequence can compensate for imperfect base pairing within the seed segment. To our knowledge, only one recent computational approach (Yan et al., 2007) has considered the contributions of the out-seed miRNA segment in target identification.


Several methods for the prediction of miRNA targets have emerged recently. These methods mainly use sequence complementarity, thermodynamic stability calculations and evolutionary conservation among species to determine the likelihood of a productive miRNA:mRNA duplex formation (Bartel, 2004; Lai, 2004). Using sequence conservation reduces false positive predictions but some less-conserved target sites may be missed. The dilemma that is posed is how to avoid rejection of less highly conserved target sites while reducing the very large numbers of predictions that will be found when seed region conservation in the target is not required.
In order to reduce the false positive predictions inherent in methods that heavily weight specific target sequence conservation, Lewis et al.(2005) developed TargetScanS. TargetScanS scores target sites based on the conservation of the target sequences between five genomes (human, mouse, rat, dog and chicken). SaeTrom et al. (2005) have developed TargetBoost, a machine-learning algorithm for miRNA target prediction using only sequence information to create weighted sequence motifs that capture the binding characteristics between miRNAs and their targets. The authors suggest that TargetBoost is stable and identifies more of the already verified true targets than do other existing algorithms.
Sung-Kyu et al. (2005), have reported the development of an algorithm using SVM with a RBF kernel, an approach with some similarities to the one we describe here. Our approach differs mainly from that of Sung-Kyu et al. in that it includes the contributions of a number of additional features we feel are important for more accurate target prediction. In addition, while artificial and random negative classes are generated by both approaches, the negative class we have generated for the current study differs from theirs. The best reported results of Sung-Kyu et al.(2005) were 0.921 as sensitivity and 0.833 as specificity. More recent work reported by Yan et al. (2007), also using a machine-learning approach, employs features extracted from the seed and out-seed segments. However, these features are different from those we have used in NBmiRTar. The best results that were obtained by Yan et al.(2007) using an optimized ensemble classifier has an accuracy of 82.95%. The results were generated using only 48 positive human and 16 negative examples, a relatively small training set.
Recently Thadani and Tammi (2006) launched MicroTar, a statistical computational tool for prediction of miRNA targets from RNA duplexes, which does not use homology for prediction. MicroTar mainly relies on a quite novel approach to estimate the duplex energy. However, the reported sensitivity (60%) is significantly lower than the sensitivity achieved using other published algorithms.
Sethupathy et al. (2006b) conducted a survey and a comparison of the five most used tools for mammalian target prediction and indicated that 30% of the experimentally validated target sites are non-conserved, supporting the need for the development of different computational approaches to capture these target sites. Rajewsky (2006) in a similar review discusses the importance of selecting the so-called control set, which we refer to is as the negative class in our terminology and an issue we have attempted to address. Lai (2004) in an additional review noted that there is almost no overlap among the predicted targets identified by the various methods and suggests that each tool captures a subset of the entire target class as a function of the specific features they have incorporated into their prediction models. Furthermore, the large number of predictions that each of these tools is producing suggests that the heavy reliance on homology or comparative sequence analysis is not sufficient to generate accurate predictions with a high sensitivity.

We present here, a machine-learning approach for predicting miRNA target site based on the naïve Bayes (NB) classifier. In our approach, we include features extracted from both the seed and ‘out seed’ sequences, the duplex structures and a number of additional sequence features. We believe that the inclusion of these features (enumerated below) contributes significantly to improving the performance of the NBmiRTar classifier. We also suggest that the negative class we have generated for training is more appropriate than those generated for previous studies. One direct use of our classifier is as a filter for the output of the miRanda tool (Enright et al., 2003; John et al., 2004). We demonstrate that this filtering step decreases the false positive prediction by miRanda significantly. The NBmiRTar algorithm demonstrates both high specificity, and a high sensitivity.
