1. INTRODUCTION The long-distance migratory movements and winter habitats of pelagic seabirds remain poorly understood, despite these animals’ role as harvesters of marine ecosystems on a global scale and their potential as indicators of ocean health (Shaffer et al. 2006). Traditional studies based on ringing recoveries or ocean sightings have proved valuable for identifying very general movement patterns, but fail to characterize any behavioural detail or discriminate important localities at sea, which may be critical both for understanding the dynamics of oceanic migration processes, and for identifying Important Bird Areas and candidate Marine Protection Area networks for conservation. New telemetry systems continue to revolutionize the study of elusive pelagic lifestyles, so that the foraging ranges and migratory behaviour of larger, predominantly southern species such as albatrosses and larger petrels are becoming much better understood (Weimerskirch et al. 2002; Phillips et al. 2006, 2008). Recently (Shaffer et al. 2006; Gonzales-Solis et al. 2007;Felicisimo et al. 2008), miniature geolocation technology has been used to track sub-1000 g seabirds on transequatorial oceanic migrations. In this study, we used geolocation technology, combined with a novel application of analytical techniques adapted from machine learning, to elucidate the details of large-scale pelagic movements in a 400 g Northern Hemisphere breeding procellariform, the Manx shearwater Puffinus puffinus, both during breeding and during its trans-equatorial, trans-Atlantic annual migration. The majority of the world population of Manx shearwaters breed in Britain and Ireland (Hamer 2003), combining spatially restricted colonial breeding with a highly pelagic lifestyle. The species is therefore of particular interest to the study of migration ecology, and potentially to understanding the impacts of changing ocean health on a global integrator of marine resources. Much of the breeding biology is known from the studies on two Welsh islands, Skokholm and Skomer (e.g. Brooke 1990), which hold in excess of 150 000 breeding pairs (Smith et al. 2001), perhaps 35–40 per cent of the total breeding population (Hamer 2003). Recently, miniature GPS devices have enabled us to track breeding birds on their feeding trips from the colony (Guilford et al. 2008) but, as with most pelagic seabirds, very little detail isknown about their behaviour or habitat requirements during the non-breeding season (September to March). Ringing recoveries indicate that Manx shearwaters spend the northern winter off the coast of South America, with most recoveries coming from Brazil (Perrins & Brooke 1976; Thompson 2002; Hamer 2003), but such data do not provide accurate wintering destinations and provide almost no behavioural detail. Furthermore, females undertake a pre-laying exodus (Brooke 1990) during which they build their large egg (15% of body weight), a critically important behavioural characteristic of procellariforms that remains poorly understood in this or any species. In addition to geolocation data, a subset (7 out of 12) of our devices collected salt-water immersion data, logging the proportion of every 10 min period that the bird was on or under the water as opposed to in the air. We used a Bayesian analysis adapted from machine learning techniques to identify distinct behavioural categories inherent in the patterns within the immersion records, and used this to shed light on the birds’ behaviour at different stages of the migratory cycle: during summer feeding, winter feeding, migration and egg formation. In particular, we identify what appear to be migratory stopover periods that we hypothesize may function in the same way as stopovers in terrestrial migrants for refuelling. We believe that this and similar machine learning techniques may have considerable usage in helping to extract more information from extant and future animal tracking datasets.
