Artificial neural networks (ANNs) [1–3] are learning models that have been successfully
used in many areas such as automatic control, weather forecasting, etc. However, they are
black boxes and consequently, it is very difficult to understand how an ANN has solved a
problem. There are a comprehensive literature about the extraction of knowledge from
learning models based on black boxes [4–14].  The principle of Zadeh’s incompatibility [15] established ‘‘the complexity of a system and
the precision with which it can be analyzed bear a roughly inverse relation to one another’’.
This principle can be applied to the ANNs . They are systems with high complexity which
can achieve a good approximation to the solution of a problem. However, it is very diffi-
cult to analyze their performance. According to this principle, the methods to understand
the action carried out by a trained ANN can be included in one of the two following
groups:
• To obtain a comprehensible system that approximates the behavior of the ANN (more
comprehension ! less complexity ! less accuracy). In this case, any rule extraction
method in [5,9–12] can be used.
• To describe the exact action of the ANN as understandably as possible (same complexity
! same accuracy ! same comprehension, but with other words). In this case, the
methods presented in [6,8,13,14] can be used.
In [14] a fuzzy rule based system (FRBS) with 2m fuzzy rules, where m is the number of
hidden neurons, equivalent to an ANN is presented. This fact involves that the FRBS
obtained is very complex. Therefore it is very difficult to discern knowledge from it.
On the other hand, the FRBS presented in this work is also equivalent to the corresponding
ANN and it has only 2 rules with straightforward antecedents. Other equivalent FRBS is proposed in [6,13]. It has m fuzzy rules, where m is also the
number of hidden neurons of the ANN. The antecedents of these rules use the same
inputs which are used in the ANN. Therefore, each antecedent has n fuzzy propositions
aggregated with the i-or operator. Thus, the FRBS has m · n propositions. This number
of propositions makes the comprehension of the fuzzy system complex. In this paper, the
method proposed obtains antecedents with only m fuzzy propositions. Hence, the number
of propositions in the fuzzy system is equal to 2 · m. This reduced number makes the
extraction of knowledge from the FRBS easier. 

8. Conclusions
A method to extract FRBSs from trained ANNs has been proposed. It carries out the
same classification as the original ANN.
To classify new data, the fuzzy rules of the system evaluate the similarity between the
input sample and the weight vectors. As a result, they are highly understandable.
Once the FRBS has been built, a simple analysis of the weight vectors is necessary to
understand the action of the network. Thus, classification problem knowledge can be
discovered using ANNs. This method of knowledge discovery has been illustrated by means
of classification problems. The knowledge extracted from the trained ANNs to solve the former
problems is coherent with the standard knowledge avalaible about the problem
considered.
