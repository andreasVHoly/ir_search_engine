HCC is a common and aggressive malignant tumor with especially high prevalence in Asia and Africa and relatively low prevalence in Europe and North America1,2. Recent studies indicate that the incidence of HCC in the US and UK has increased substantially over the last two decades3,4. Although routine screening of individuals at risk for developing HCC may extend the life of some patients, many are still diagnosed with advanced HCC and have little chance of survival5–9. A small subset of HCC patients qualifies for surgical intervention, but the consequent improvement in long-term survival is only modest10,11. The extremely poor prognosis of HCC is largely the result of a high rate of recurrence after surgery or of intra-hepatic metastases that develop through invasion of the portal vein or spread to other parts of the liver; extra-hepatic metastases are less common12,13. These data indicate that the liver is the main target organ of HCC metastasis. The portal vein is the main route for intrahepatic metastases of HCC cells in animal model systems and in human patients14–16. This feature of HCC underscores the need to develop an accurate molecular profiling model to improve diagnosis and identify therapeutic targets for the treatment of HCC patients with intra-hepatic metastases. Current studies have been largely focused on individual candidate genes17–19, an approach that may be insufficient to precisely define the genetic basis of metastatic HCC. Microarray technology allows us to examine disease-related gene expression on a global genome scale20. This approach has resulted in successful molecular classification of several human malignant tumors with respect to their stage, prognostic outcome or response to therapy21–26. A few reports have dealt with the gene expression profiles of primary HCC samples27,28, but little is known about the molecular signature associated with a poor prognosis for metastatic HCC. We applied cDNA microarray–based gene expression profiling to investigate the global changes associated with HCC metastasis. Our initial goal was to identify genes that distinguish primary tumors from their matched intra-hepatic metastatic lesions. Unexpectedly, we found that the intra-hepatic metastatic lesions were indistinguishable from their primary tumors, regardless of tumor size, encapsulation and age of patient. Primary metastasis-free HCC was distinct from primary HCC with metastasis. These data indicate that changes favoring intra-hepatic metastasis are initiated in the primary HCC. In addition, we showed that osteopontin, a secreted phosphoprotein, is a significant factor in HCC metastasis. Osteopontin over-expression correlated with metastatic potential of primary HCC and with invasiveness of liver tumor–derived cell lines in vitro. An osteopontin-neutralizing antibody efficiently blocked in vitro invasion and in vivo pulmonary metastasis of HCC cells. Our studies identify osteopontin as both a molecular marker for defining HCC patients with metastatic potential and a potential therapeutic target for metastatic HCC.
