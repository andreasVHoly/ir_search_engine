A Machine-Learning Approach to Automated Knowledge-Base Building for Remote Sensing Image Analysis with Gis Data

Introduction Incorporating supplemental GIS information and human expert knowledge into digital image processing have long been acknowledged as a necessity for improving remote sensing image analysis. Enslin et al. (1987) pointed out that geographers should examine how GIS can be used to improve image classification through application of the logic and techniques of artificial intelligence. In recent years, a number of studies have used expert systems (sometimes called knowledge-based systems) to perform image analysis, many of which incorporate GIS data (Mckeown, 1987; Civco, 1989; Skidmore, 1989; Newkirk and Wang, 1990; Argialas and Harlow, 1990; Bolstad and Lillesand, 1992; Janssen and Middelkoop, 1992; Westmoreland and Stow, 1992; Knotoes et al., 1993). The heart of the expert system approach is its knowledge base (Luger and Stubblefield, 1993). The usual method of acquiring knowledge in a computer-usable format to build a knowledge base involves human domain experts and knowledge engineers (Figure la). The domain expert explicitly expresses his or her knowledge about a subject in a language that can be understood by the knowledge engineer. The knowledge engineer translates the domain knowledge into a computer-usable format and stores it in the knowledge base. This process presents a well-known problem when creating expert systems that is often referred to as the "knowledge acquisition bottleneck." The reasons are (Bratko, et al., 1989): (1) the process requires the engagement of the domain expert and the knowledge engineer over a long period of 
time, and (2), although experts are capable of using their knowledge in their decision making, they are often incapable of formulating their knowledge explicitly in a form sufficiently systematic, correct, and complete to form a computer application. Some remote sensing scientists have acknowledged the difficulties in building knowledge bases for image analysis (Argialas and Harlow, 1990; Kontoes et al., 1993). To solve this problem, much effort has been exerted in the artificial intelligence community to automate knowledge acquisition to obtain low-cost and high-quality knowledge bases (Maniezzo and Morpurgo, 1993). Studies on automated knowledge acquisition belong to the subfield of artificial intelligence known as machine learning (Carbonell et al., 1983). Machine learning has been used to automate knowledgebase building for expert systems in many areas. Although there are some applications of machine learning techniques in the area of spatial data processing and analysis, most of them are in spatial modeling (Walker and Moore, 1988; Moor et al., 1991; Aspinall, 1992). Little effort has been made to apply the techniques to automate knowledge-base building for remote sensing image analysis with GIS data. This paper describes the logic and development of a machine-learning methodology to automatically build a knowledge base for an integrated image analysis expert system that incorporates remotely sensed and GIs data. This method eliminates or reduces the difficulty caused by the "knowledge acquisition bottleneck," and should allow expert system techniques to be adopted more easily by remote sensing and GIs scientists.

Conclusions A method of automated knowledge-base construction for image analysis expert systems with GIS data was developed based on an inductive machine-learning technique. With this method, building a knowledge base for a rule-based expert system for remote sensing image analysis with GIS data is easier than using the conventional knowledge acquisition approach. It does not require that domain experts explicitly express their knowledge and does not require knowledge engineers to code the knowledge. However, it is imperative that appropriate training data be selected. An operational image expert system was developed to test the utility of the knowledge base generated by the machine-learning approach. The accuracy assessment and the analysis of the resultant production rules suggest that the knowledge base built by the machine-learning method was of good quality for image analysis. With several types of GIS data, it produced results superior to those of conventional approaches. This study demonstrated the utility of GIS data to improve remote sensing classification. It also demonstrated that selecting the appropriate approach when incorporating GIS data was very important. Because GIs data usually do not meet the Gaussian distribution assumption, maximum-likelihood classification may not be an appropriate method. On the other hand, the expert-system approach proved to be a robust and effective way to incorporate GIS data because it does not have such a data distribution requirement. The research also demonstrated some other advantages of the machine-learning-assisted expert-system approach: it was easy to understand, and the resultant knowledge could be used in other applications. For example, from Rule 2 in Figure 7b, one can know that most of the hardwoodlpine class was distributed above 195 m in the Par Pond area. Such spatial knowledge is very useful in many geographic applications such as spatial analysis and modeling. However, such data cannot be obtained from the conventional statistical classifications using the maximum-likelihood classification algorithm.
