I. INTRODUCTION
OVER the past two decades utilities worldwide have gone
through radical changes. One big change is the deregulation
of the energy market that has taken place in a number of
countries worldwide. Another change is that today’s customers
are more demanding than customers in the past. These changes
have forced the utilities to become even more customer-oriented
where high network reliability and good power quality
have been increasingly important to keep customers satisfied.
Therefore, recording and analyzing voltage disturbances (also
referred to as voltage events) and power quality abnormalities
have become a vital issue in order to better understand the
behavior of the power network. Disturbance data and power
quality data have become important information both for statistical
purposes and as a decision-making document in mitigation
projects. Reliable disturbance and power quality information
also open up for proactive maintenance approach with focus on
increasing the power network reliability. Today most of the disturbance
data is analyzed manually by specialists. However, a
lot of time could be saved if unimportant or minor disturbances could be removed or classified automatically. Thereby, the specialists
could focus on solving more sophisticated disturbance
problems. This requires the development of robust automatic
classification systems. A number of works based on different
techniques for detection and classification of power quality phenomena
have been published over the past years. Theoretical
foundations of voltage disturbances are for example described
in [1], [2]. Classification methods of power quality disturbances
based on wavelet analysis are reported in [3] and [4], based
on the statistical maximum-likelihood method in [5] and a
rule-based expert system in [6]. Another powerful technique
is based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.
Examples of work related to this subject and implementations
based on neural-networks are described in [7]–[10]. During the
last few years yet another classification method—the support
vector machine (SVM)—has been increasingly popular due
to its interesting theoretical and practical characteristics. The
SVM which is based on statistical learning theory is a general
classification method and its theoretical foundation is described
in [11] and [12]. Applications within power delivery and power
systems using SVM are for example reported in [13]–[15].
However before the SVM algorithm (or any other classification
method) becomes attractive to implement commercially it
must be able to be pretrained from factory and fed with global
settings. It is not realistic that the customer itself should be
responsible to train the SVM before it can be used.
Motivated by this, the aim of this work was to investigate
the performance of a SVM classifier used for classification of
the most common voltage disturbances when training data and
testing data originate from different sources. Data originating
both from real power networks and from synthetic data were
used in the experiments. The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows.
Section II gives a brief overview of the theory of support vector
machines. Section III discusses power network disturbances
and feature extraction philosophies used to characterize different
disturbance types. Section IV describes the proposed
SVM-based classification system. In Section V, the conducted
experiments are described and the results evaluated. Finally,
conclusions are given in Section VI.  


VI. CONCLUSION
This paper proposes a novel method based on the SVM algorithm
for classification of common types of voltage disturbances.
The results from the conducted experiments have shown
high classification accuracy, implying that the SVM classification
technique is an attractive choice for classification of this
type of data.
The accuracy of the proposed method is also dependent on the
selected features used for the classifier. The work described in
this paper has shown that by using features extracted both from
time-domain and frequency-domain, the SVM classifier yields
high performance. The proposed classifier is shown to be effective
by using individually trained SVMs as nodes in a binary
decision tree for multiple class classification. The advantage is that it is straight forward to extend the system when new types
of disturbances are added to the classifier.
In this work, data were used from two different power networks
as well as synthetic data in order to evaluate the performance
of the SVM classifier. High performance was achieved
when the training data were originated from the power network
and slightly less accuracy was achieved when the classifier was
trained on synthetic data. However, by adding training data originated
from a real power network to the synthetic training data
set, the classification performance increased significantly. From
an implementation standpoint, it is highly demanded that the
classifier is based purely on synthetic data since synthetic data
are easier to obtain as compared to real data
