Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) are the most common lymphoid neoplasms, composing 30–40% of adult non-Hodgkin lymphomas1 . Although a subset of DLBCL patients are cured with current chemotherapeutic regimens, most succumb to the disease2 . Clinical prognostic models such as the International Prognostic Index (IPI) have been developed to identify DLBCL patients who are unlikely to be cured with standard therapy3 . However, the clinical factors of the IPI (age, performance status, stage, number of extranodal sites and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH))3 are likely to be surrogate markers for the intrinsic molecular heterogeneity in this disease. Therefore, it is not surprising that IPI is imperfect in its identification of high-risk patients. In addition, in the absence of molecular insights into the clinical heterogeneity of DLBCL, therapeutic approaches to high-risk patients have primarily included increased doses of conventional chemotherapeutic agents and additional stem-cell support4 . However, the value of high-dose therapy has not been confirmed in this setting4 , underscoring the need to identify more rational, molecularly defined approaches to treatment. Molecular analyses of clinical heterogeneity in DLBCL have largely focused on individual candidate genes, with particularemphasis on genes with known functions in other malignancies or in normal lymphocyte development. Examples include adhesion molecules that influence the trafficking of normal activated B cells and tumor cells5,6, proteins that regulate apoptosis in other B-cell lymphomas and normal B-cell subpopulations7–9, and angiogenic peptides that promote the development of an effective tumor vasculature10. Additional individual genes, such as BAL (B-aggressive lymphoma), have been identified on the basis of their differential expression in fatal high-risk DLBCL and cured low-risk tumors11. Although some of these candidate genes correlate with DLBCL treatment outcome, a comprehensive molecular approach to outcome prediction is still lacking. The recent development of DNA microarrays provides an opportunity to take a genome-wide approach to predicting DLBCL treatment outcome. One strategy is to use gene-expression profiling to extend current biological insights into the disease. Such an approach was recently described by Alizadeh et al., who built on the hypothesis that DLBCL derives from normal B cells located within the germinal centers (GCs) of lymphoid organs12,13. Customized cDNA (‘lymphochip’) microarrays enriched in genes related to the GCs were used to obtain the gene-expression patterns of DLBCL and normal lymphocytes, including B cells from GC B cells and in vitro-activated peripheral blood (PB) B cells. Using the unsupervised learning technique of hierarchical clustering, Alizadeh et al.12 demonstrated that the DLBCLs fell into two groups: those with expression patterns similar to normal GC B cells, and those with expression patterns similar to in vitro-activated PB B cells. Alizadeh et al.12 found the GC-like DLBCLs to have a more favorable outcome compared with the PB-like DLBCLs, suggesting that putative cell of origin might be predictive of response to treatment in this disease. An alternative strategy for the prediction of DLBCL outcome is to use supervised learning methods to directly develop a geneexpression–based outcome model that is independent of a priori hypotheses. Here we report the successful prediction of outcome in a series of 58 DLBCL patients using gene-expression data from oligonucleotide microarrays together with supervised learning methods. Notably, this supervised approach identifies molecular correlates of outcome that are independent of the previously described putative cell of origin12.
