1. Introduction
Slovenia lies at the north-western tip of the Dinaric-Eastern Alps brown bear population, which extends from the Eastern Alps southwards to the Pindus Mountain Range in Greece. The species seems to be highly productive in Slovenia (Adamic and Koren, 1998). Its range in Slovenia is expanding progressively, extending towards the west, into the Littoral Karst and towards north-west into the Alps (Adamic, 1994 and Adamic, 1997). With its geographical position and a viable bear population, Slovenia plays an important role in future welfare of the species in central Europe. Future conservation strategy in Slovenia is aimed towards a long term preservation of a viable population of brown bear with surplus reproduction rates, ensuring the persistence of the population under increased pressures, which are to be expected in future even in the key habitats. Spatial extension of the current core bear protection area into the north-western part of the Dinaric Mountain Range is of great importance both for the conservation of the species in Slovenia and for enabling dispersion towards the historical habitats in the Alps. According to the study of Corsi et al. (1998), the Alps represent a vast area of potential, yet unoccupied brown bear habitat of different degrees of suitability.

Habitat models are receiving attention as tools to understand habitat relations of the organisms, to evaluate habitat quality, and to develop habitat management strategies (Verner et al., 1986). Such models can be either (1) developed a priori based on expert knowledge and by successive approximation and testing on new data or (2) they can be induced a posteriori from already collected data. In the first case the method of acquiring knowledge in a computer usable format often involves a domain expert, who provides the knowledge, and a knowledge engineer, who encodes this knowledge into computer-usable knowledge base. This presents the problem of ‘knowledge acquisition bottleneck’, because (1) domain experts are often incapable of formulating their knowledge explicitly, systematically, and completely enough to form a computer application and (2) the process is time-consuming (Bratko et al., 1989).

The second approach using the a posteriori induction of a knowledge base was used for this study, because field data and geolocated observations of brown bears have been collected systematically in Slovenia for years for bear population monitoring. The geolocated sightings of the animals inherently contain some information on bears’ use of habitat. Conventional inductive statistics, multivariate techniques and logistic regression are sometimes used to develop habitat suitability models from such data. Radeloff et al. (1999) implemented a habitat suitability model of roe deer in GIS, using a multiple regression of four parameters. Pereira and Itami (1991) developed a habitat suitability model for the Mt. Graham red squirrel by logistic multiple regression model, where GIS was used to provide the inputs to the model. Li et al. (1997) applied logistic regression in combination with principal components and spatial autocorrelation analysis to predict the spatial distribution of red-crown crane. Mladenoff and Sickley (1998) used GIS and logistic regression model based on regional road abundance to spatially estimate the grey wolf habitat.

In addition to statistical methods, there are also artificial intelligence (AI) methods, which can automate knowledge-base building and even present the learned knowledge in an easily understood form. Machine learning approaches, as a field within AI, include statistical techniques like Bayesian classification, neural networks, nearest neighbor methods and symbolic techniques like classification/regression trees, equation discovery and inductive logic programming. Using artificial neural networks Özesmi and Özesmi (1998) developed a habitat selection model of marsh-breeding bird species. The classification tree method (Bell, 1999) has been used in connection with GIS and remote sensing by Huang and Jensen (1997) to map wetland habitat and by Kobler et al. (2000) to distinguish forest/non-forest. Moore et al. (1991) predicted the distribution of forest communities from topographic and edaphic variables. Bell (1996) investigated the application of the classification tree method to the bird habitat associations of the red grouse. Fabricius and Coetzee (1992) and Bell (1999) used the classification trees to predict the presence or absence for mountain reedbuck and pronghorn respectively, based on historical data on presence/absence and various independent variables, describing vegetation, relief, and distance to water. Several habitat models were also developed specifically for the brown bear in the same geographic area as ours or in the neighboring areas. E.g. Kusak and Huber (1998) used the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (1981) habitat evaluating procedure for the Gorski Kotar region in Croatia, Dupre et al. (1999) produced a map of suitable habitats in Central Italian Alps by assessing potential habitat and human disturbances separately and Knauer and Kaczensky (1999) used telemetric data to build a logistic regression habitat model in Slovenia.

In this paper we assess brown bear habitat in western Slovenia using existing geocoded data on bear population spatial distribution as well as geographical information system (GIS) data layers covering several ecological aspects of the study area. We developed a habitat suitability model using AI tool and a raster GIS, assuming that the available recorded observations of brown bear approximate the actual spatial preferences of the bear population reasonably well, so they present a suitable basis for automated creation of the knowledge base for subsequent classification of habitat suitability within the study area.

5. Discussion
In contrast to our model where knowledge was induced from training data, Kusak and Huber (1998) based their model on expert knowledge and literature. The most important component of the Kusak–Huber model was food availability whereas in our model it was the percentage of forest cover. The influence of large forest patches on bear movements in Slovenia was modeled by Knauer and Kaczensky (1999), however we were unable to compare the performance of the Knauer–Kaczensky model to our model, since the authors did not report the accuracy. Compared to the decision tree model of mountain reedbuck in South Africa by Fabricius and Coetzee (1992), our model yielded a higher classification accuracy in spite of considerably smaller decision tree size (12 vs. 125 leaves). The main reasons for this are probably (1) using an estimate of the inhabited area instead of the raw bear locations, in order to exclude the random animal excursions and thus lower the noise in the training data set and (2) exclusion of the fragmented habitat patches from our model.

Most of the study area is covered by forests, still only one quarter of the entire study area was classified as habitat and only one-third of the forests were considered suitable for bear habitat. This gives us some indication of how the landscape had been altered from its natural state. Females with cubs do not disperse as widely as males (Swenson et al., 1998b) and therefore tend to be less selective regarding their habitat. Since only locations of female bears with cubs were used for training, the decision tree presents a conservative estimate of the habitat. The actual habitat area including corridors for moving between patches of optimal habitat is probably larger. The final filtered model generally agreed with the domain knowledge – the main GIS layer describing the suitability of each cell for bear habitat in the study area was the percentage of forest and only large habitat patches were considered. A high influence of large forest patches on bear movements was stressed in Slovenia by Knauer and Kaczensky (1999) and in European Russia by Pazhetnov (1993) and Vaisfeld (1993). Whereas our model accounts for proximity to settlements, it neglects food availability. This agrees with Swenson et al. (1998), who maintain that the brown bears are found in forested areas with low human density, but the population survival is determined more by the presence of a protective forest cover than by the availability of food.

Additional rules in the subordinate branches of the decision tree account for differences in the forest association and rural population percentage. However the forest associations grouped together in any of the final branches are very diverse and no clear understanding of bears’ preferences regarding forest vegetation could be obtained from the decision tree. In this respect the machine learning results are limited by the quality of the training data set. Improvements are needed in this respect. To account for a wider spectrum of possible habitat types we also need to enlarge the geographic extent of the training data set to all areas in Slovenia inhabited by brown bear. In the decision tree the problem of different spatial scales of the input data manifested itself through the influence of CLC-derived PERCENTAGE_OF_FOREST attribute (see also the jagged habitat edge in Fig. 2), which has a 1×1 km2 resolution, effectively lowering the resolution of the whole model from 500 m to 1 km.

The spatial representation of the model in a GIS environment showed a degree of habitat fragmentation that could not be recognized from the decision tree alone. The small fragments could be filtered out with a GIS-based spatial filter, which reduced the commission errors without causing a lot of omissions, thus increasing the accuracy of the habitat map. GIS enabled us to include also some spatial aspects of the habitat model, it facilitated data storage and querying, and we were also able to derive new kinds of data from basic data layers using GIS tools. The combined GIS – machine learning method turned out to be cost- and time-efficient, producing a simple but useful model of brown bear habitat. We were thus able to maximize the information obtainable from the recorded bear sightings, which had been originally gathered for another purpose.

While a highway network is being completed in Slovenia, somewhere also cutting through the large continuous forests, our study confirmed the importance of forests for brown bear habitat in Slovenia and indicating a need for mitigation measures (appropriate highway throughpasses). Our model could contribute to the clarification of the current controversy over the carrying capacity of the natural and social environment in western Slovenia for bears and it could be used to support spatial decisions (e.g. extension of the current core bear protection area). Considering a recent surge in domestic sheep depredation in alpine Slovenia by brown bear (Adamic, 1996), the model could also be useful to identify lower risk pasture areas.
