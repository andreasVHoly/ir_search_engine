REAL-TIME traffic classification has the potential to solve difficult network management problems for Internet service providers (ISPs) and their equipment vendors. Network operators need to know what is flowing over their networks promptly so they can react quickly in support of their various business goals. Traffic classification may be a core part of automated intrusion detection systems [1] [2] [3], used to detect patterns indicative of denial of service attacks, trigger automated re-allocation of network resources for priority customers [4], or identify customer use of network resources that in some way contravenes the operator’s terms of service. More recently, governments are also clarifying ISP obligations with respect to ‘lawful interception’ (LI) of IP data traffic [5]. Just as telephone companies must support interception of telephone usage, ISPs are increasingly subject to government requests for information on network use by particular individuals at particular points in time. IP traffic classification is an integral part of ISP-based LI solutions. Commonly deployed IP traffic classification techniques have been based around direct inspection of each packet’s contents at some point on the network. Successive IP packets having the same 5-tuple of protocol type, source address:port and destination address:port are considered to belong to a flowwhose controlling application we wish to determine. Simple classification infers the controlling application’s identity by assuming that most applications consistently use ‘well known’ TCP or UDP port numbers (visible in the TCP or UDP headers). However, many applications are increasingly using unpredictable (or at least obscure) port numbers [6]. Consequently, more sophisticated classification techniques infer application type by looking for application-specific data (or well-known protocol behavior) within the TCP or UDP payloads [7]. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of such ‘deep packet inspection’ techniques is diminishing. Such packet inspection relies on two related assumptions: • Third parties unaffiliated with either source or recipient are able to inspect each IP packet’s payload (i.e. is the payload visible) • The classifier knows the syntax of each application’s packet payloads (i.e. can the payload be interpreted) Two emerging challenges undermine the first assumption - customers may use encryption to obfuscate packet contents (including TCP or UDP port numbers), and governments may impose privacy regulations constraining the ability of third parties to lawfully inspect payloads at all. The second assumption imposes a heavy operational load - commercial devices will need repeated updates to stay ahead of regular (or simply gratuitous) changes in every application’s packet payload formats. The research community has responded by investigating classification schemes capable of inferring application-level usage patterns without deep inspection of packet payloads. Newer approaches classify traffic by recognising statistical patterns in externally observable attributes of the traffic (such as typical packet lengths and inter-packet arrival times). Their ultimate goal is either clustering IP traffic flows into groups that have similar traffic patterns, or classifying one or more applications of interest. A number of researchers are looking particularly closely at the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques (a subset of the wider Artificial Intelligence discipline) to IP traffic classification. The application of ML techniques involves a number of steps. First, features are defined by which future unknown IP traffic may be identified and differentiated. Features are attributes of flows calculated over multiple packets (such as maximum or minimum packet lengths in each direction, flow durations or inter-packet arrival times). Then the ML classifier is trained to associate sets of features with known traffic classes (creating rules), and apply the ML algorithm to classify unknown traffic using previously learned rules. Every ML algorithm has a different approach to sorting and   prioritising sets of features, which leads to different dynamic behaviors during training and classification. In this paper we provide the rationale for IP traffic classification in IP networks, review the state-of-the-art approaches to traffic classification, and then review and critique emerging ML-based techniques for IP traffic classification. The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Section II outlines the importance of IP traffic classification in operational networks, introduces a number of metrics for assessing classification accuracy, and discusses the limitations of traditional port- and payload-based classification. Section III provides background information about ML and how it can be applied in IP traffic classification. The section also discusses a number of key requirements for the employment of ML-based classifiers in operational IP networks. Section IV reviews the significant works in this field (predominantly from 2004 to early 2007). The section is wrapped up with a qualitative discussion of the extent to which the reviewed works meet the requirements specified in section III. Section V concludes the paper with some final remarks and suggestions of possible future work.
