Fuzzy rule selection by multi-objective genetic local search algorithms and rule evaluation measures in data mining

Fuzzy rule-based systems have been successfully applied to various application areas such as control and classi-cation [20,21]. While the main objective in the design offuzzy rule-based systems has been the performance maximization, their comprehensibility has also been taken into account in some recent studies [3,4,19,24,25,27,28]. The comprehensibility offuzzy rule-based systems is related to various factors: (i) Comprehensibility offuzzy partitions (e.g., linguistic interpretability ofeach fuzzy set, separation of neighboring fuzzy sets, the number of fuzzy sets for each variable). (ii) Simplicity offuzzy rule-based systems (e.g., the number ofinput variables, the number offuzzy if-then rules). (iii) Simplicity of fuzzy if-then rules (e.g., type of fuzzy if-then rules, the number of antecedent conditions in each fuzzy if-then rule). (iv) Simplicity offuzzy reasoning (e.g., selection ofa single winner rule, voting by multiple rules). In this paper, we show how a small number of simple fuzzy if-then rules can be selected for designing a comprehensible fuzzy rule-based system for a pattern classi-cation problem with many continuous attributes. Among the above four issues, the second and third ones are mainly discussed in this paper. The -rst issue (i.e., comprehensibility offuzzy partitions) is considered in this paper as a part of a preprocessing procedure for fuzzy rule generation. That is, we assume that the domain interval ofeach continuous attribute has already been discretized into several fuzzy sets. In computer simulations, we use simple homogeneous fuzzy partitions. See [19,24,25,27,28] for the determination of comprehensible fuzzy partitions from numerical data. Partition methods into non-fuzzy intervals have been studied in the area ofmachine learning (e.g., [6,7,26]). A straightforward approach to the design of simple fuzzy rule-based systems is rule selection. In our former studies [14,15], we proposed a genetic algorithm-based approach for selecting a small number of fuzzy if-then rules from a large number of candidate rules. The GA-based approach was extended to the case oftwo-objective rule selection for explicitly considering a tradeoF between the number of fuzzy if-then rules and the classi-cation accuracy [10]. This approach was further extended in [12] to the case ofthree-objective rule selection by including the minimization ofthe total rule length (i.e., total number ofantecedent conditions). When the GA-based rule selection approach is applied to high-dimensional pattern classi-cation problems, a prescreening procedure ofcandidate rules is necessary because the number ofpossible fuzzy if-then rules exponentially increases with the dimensionality ofpattern spaces. In [10,14,15], the GA-based approach was only applied to low-dimensional pattern classi-cation problems where no prescreening procedure was necessary for decreasing the number of candidate rules. A simple prescreening procedure based on rule length was used for handling high-dimensional problems in [12]. In this paper, we propose an idea ofutilizing rule evaluation measures in data mining as prescreening criteria. An arbitrarily speci-ed number of candidate rules can be generated from numerical data for high-dimensional pattern classi-cation problems using rule evaluation measures. We also extend our multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) in [10,12] to a multi-objective genetic local search (MOGLS) algorithm by combining local search and rule weight learning with our MOGA. This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we show how we can use two rule evaluation measures (i.e., con%dence and support ofassociation rules) in data mining for prescreening candidate fuzzy if-then rules. Three prescreening criteria (i.e., con-dence, support, and their product) are compared with one another through computer simulations on a wine classi-cation problem with 13 continuous attributes. We also examine some alternative heuristic de-nitions ofrule weights through computer simulations. In Section 3, we describe our MOGA designed for -nding non-dominated rule sets with respect to three objectives from candidate rules. Through computer simulations, we demonstrate that the e2ciency ofour MOGA can be improved by the use ofa prescreening procedure. In Section 4, we implement an MOGLS algorithm by combining local search and rule weight learning with our MOGA. In Section 5, we examine the generalization ability of rule sets obtained by our approach through computer simulations on several pattern classi-cation problems. Section 6 concludes this paper.
