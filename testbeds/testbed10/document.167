Application of machine learning techniques
for supply chain demand forecasting

1. Introduction
Recently, firms have begun to realize the importance
of sharing information and integration across
the stakeholders in the supply chain (Zhao et al.,
2002). Although such initiatives reduce forecast
errors, they are neither ubiquitous nor complete and forecast errors still abound. Collaborative forecasting
and replenishment (CFAR) permits a firm
and its supplier-firm to coordinate decisions by
exchanging complex decision-support models and
strategies, thus facilitating integration of forecasting
and production schedules (Raghunathan, 1999).
However, in the absence of CFAR, firms are relegated
to traditional forecasting and production
scheduling. As a result, the firm’s demand (e.g.,
the manufacturer’s demand) appears to fluctuate
in a random fashion even if the final customer’s
demand has a predictable pattern. Forecasting the
manufacturer’s demand under these conditions
becomes a challenging task due to a well-known ‘‘bullwhip effect’’ (Lee et al., 1997a) – a result of
information asymmetry.
The objectives of this research are to study the
feasibility and perform a comparative analysis of
forecasting the distorted demand signals in the
extended supply chain using non-linear machine
learning techniques. More specifically, the work
focuses on forecasting the demand at the upstream
end of the supply chain. The main challenge lies in
the distortion of the demand signal as it travels
through the extended supply chain. Our use of the
term extended supply chain reflects both the holistic
notion of supply chain as presented by Tan (2001)
and the idealistic collaborative relationships suggested
by Davis and Spekman (2004).
The value of information sharing across the supply
chain is widely recognized as the means of combating
demand signal distortion (Lee et al., 1997b).
However, there is a gap between the ideal of integrated
supply chains and the reality (Gunasekaran,
2004). A number of factors could hinder such longterm
stable collaborative efforts. Premkumar (2000)
lists some critical issues that must be addressed in
order to permit successful supply chain collaboration.
These issues include:

• alignment of business interests;
• long-term relationship management;
• reluctance to share information;
• complexity of large-scale supply chain
management;
• competence of personnel supporting supply chain
management;
• performance measurement and incentive systems
to support supply chain management.
In most companies these issues have not yet been
addressed in any attempts to enable effective
extended supply chain collaboration (Davis and
Spekman, 2004). Moreover, in many supply chains
there are power regimes and power sub-regimes that
can prevent supply chain optimization (Cox et al.,
2001; Watson, 2001). ‘‘Hence, even if it is technically
feasible to integrate systems and share information,
organizationally it may not be feasible
because it may cause major upheavals in the power
structure’’ (Premkumar, 2000, p. 62). Furthermore,
it has been mathematically demonstrated, that while
participants in supply chains may gain certain benefits
from advance information sharing, it actually
tends to increase the bullwhip effect (Thonemann,
2002). Another complicating factor is the possibility of
the introduction of inaccurate information into the
system. Inaccurate information too would lead to
demand distortion, as was the case reported in a
study of the telecom industry demand chain where
some partners were double forecasting and ration
gaming (Heikkila¨, 2002), despite the fact that there
was a collaborative system in place and a push for
the correct use of this system.
Finally, with the advance of E-business there is
an increasing tendency towards more ‘‘dynamic’’
(Vakharia, 2002) and ‘‘agile’’ (Gunasekaran and
Ngai, 2004; Yusuf et al., 2004) supply chains. While
this trend enables the supply chains to be more flexible
and adaptive, it could discourage companies
from investing into forming long-term collaborative
relationships among each other due to the restrictive
nature of such commitments.

6. Conclusion
The objective of this research was to study the
effectiveness of forecasting the distorted demand
signals in the extended supply chain with advanced
non-linear machine learning techniques.
The results are important for situations where
parties in the supply chain cannot collaborate for
the reasons discussed in the beginning of the paper.
In such cases, the ability to increase forecasting
accuracy will result in lower costs and higher customer
satisfaction because of more on-time
deliveries.
Although showing better results overall, the
advanced techniques did not provide a large
improvement over more ‘‘traditional techniques’’
(as represented by the MLR model) for the simulation
data set. However, for the real foundries data,
the more advanced data mining techniques (RNN
and SVM) provide larger improvements. Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNN) and Support Vector
Machines (SVM) provide the best results on the
foundries test set. We can also see that the trend
estimation and naı¨ve forecast are the worst types
of demand signal processing since they have the
highest level of error.
Overall, we can conclude that the use of machine
learning techniques and MLR for forecasting distorted
demand signals in the extended supply chain provide more accurate forecasts than simpler forecasting
techniques (including naı¨ve, trend, and moving
average). However, we did not find that machine
learning techniques show significantly better performance
then linear regression. Thus, the marginal
gain in accuracy of the RNN and SVM models
should be weighed in practice against the conceptual
and computational simplicity of the linear regression
model.
Future research could be directed to investigating
the impacts of information sharing on forecasting
accuracy, e.g., using the Internet, and other e-business
technologies, as a means of enabling firms to
coordinate decisions with their various partners
(Vakharia, 2002). To study the impact of collaborative
forecasting, the current simulations, models and
techniques can be used while providing additional
information from down the supply chain to the data
mining tools. This additional information would
likely increase the model’s accuracy. However, as
demonstrated by Frohlich (2002), as long as barriers
remain, integration of decision making will continue
to be a constraint. Such constraints might be alleviated
with our model.
