Machine learning (ML) (1) is the study of computer algorithms capable of learning to improve their performance of a task on the basis of their own previous experience. The field is closely related to pattern recognition and statistical inference. As an engineering field, ML has become steadily more mathematical and more successful in applications over the past 20 years. Learning approaches such as data clustering, neural network classifiers, and nonlinear regression have found surprisingly wide application in the practice of engineering, business, and science. A generalized version of the standard Hidden Markov Models of ML practice have been used for ab initio prediction of gene structures in genomic DNA (2). The predictions correlate surprisingly well with subsequent gene expression analysis (3). Postgenomic biology prominently features large-scale gene expression data analyzed by clustering methods (4), a standard topic in unsupervised learning. Many other examples can be given of learning and pattern recognition applications in science. Where will this trend lead? We believe it will lead to appropriate, partial automation of every element of scientific method, from hypothesis generation to model construction to decisive experimentation. Thus, ML has the potential to amplify every aspect of a working scientist's progress to understanding. It will also, for better or worse, endow intelligent computer systems with some of the general analytic power of scientific thinking. 


Conclusions
Despite the obstacles, current machine learning (ML) research is producing impressive advances on some fundamental issues. These include scaling up ML methods to large sample and dimension sizes, finding the productive balance between generative and discriminative approaches, and focusing attention on the most useful data (e.g., active learning). We expect steady progress on these core areas of ML research in coming years.
Some core ML research directions are especially likely to further the partial automation of scientific processes. These include learning from nonvector data such as labeled graphs, text, and images; multiscale methods for large-scale optimization in inference; and feature selection to find the most relevant aspects of large data sets.
A particularly exciting recent trend in ML research has been the development of nonlinear Mercer kernel versions of many classic linear methods [e.g., kernel PCA, kernel nearest-neighbor, and kernel Fischer discriminates (30)] and domain-specific kernels [e.g., (31)]. The promise of such kernel methods is the ability to learn highly accurate models on large feature spaces, while overcoming the traditional “curse of dimensionality.” We expect breakthroughs in this area, both for new algorithms and for new powerful domain-specific kernels (32).
Although we have focused on semiautomated, human-interactive scientific inference, there is already demand for more fully automatic inference in special situations. Such situations include very short or long time scales or locations inhospitable to human intervention, such as robotic planetary exploration missions. It will be a fascinating and instructive endeavor—requiring contributions across technology, science, and even philosophy—to develop and understand the full spectrum of such scientific inference systems.
