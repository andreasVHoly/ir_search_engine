Argumentation in artificial intelligence

1. Introduction In its classical treatment within philosophy, the study of argumentation may, informally, be considered as concerned with how assertions are proposed, discussed, and resolved in the context of issues upon which several diverging opinions may be held. Thus philosophical investigations of argumentation, from Aristotle to the present day, have addressed such themes as: the mechanisms by which “legitimate” argumentation in support of a claim may be distinguished from “flawed” argumentation; analyses of the typical structures that constitute argument components and argumentation development; the processes by which participants engaging in debate may advance their respective positions and undermine contrary stances and arguments, etc; and the contexts in which these questions are decided. The importance of such philosophical theories to so-called everyday reasoning has a long and distinguished history in AI, and contributions from contemporary philosophical analyses continue to play a major role in the evolution of effective computational exploitation of argumentation technology. Within the simplified overview of argumentation outlined in the preceding paragraph, one can, already, identify a number of themes whose elements embody issues of a computational nature in the following:

• Defining the component parts of an argument and their interaction. • Identifying rules and protocols describing argumentation processes. • Distinguishing legitimate from invalid arguments. • Determining conditions under which further discussion is redundant. It is, of course, the case that similar issues underpin one well-established and highly-developed theory: that of formal logic and mathematical proof. It is no coincidence that much of the formal computational treatment of argumentation has its roots in ideas developed from AI inspired contributions to logic and deductive reasoning. So one finds in mathematical proof theory core concepts such as: precisely defined means for expressing assertions (e.g. formulae in a given logical language); accepted bases on which to build theorems (e.g. collections of axioms); procedures prescribing the means by which further theorems may be derived from existing theorems and axioms (e.g. templates for inference rules); and precise concepts of termination (e.g. a sentential form is derivable as a theorem, “true”; or is logically invalid, “false”). While the structural elements presented in this view of mathematical reasoning have proven to be a useful basis in the development of argumentation-based models in AI, the formal apparatus and methods of mathematical reasoning are, ultimately, radically different in nature to those of importance when considering the concept of argumentation as it is familiar from everyday contexts, e.g. as it might occur in political debate, the discussion of ethical principles, deliberation in judicial settings, etc. While there are, of course, parallels that can be made,—e.g. that those engaged in debate have some collection of accepted premises on which there is agreement, possibly, even, some recognition of when contributions to a discussion are “unreasonable” or flawed, etc.—there are, however, a number of fundamental distinctions between the concepts “P is a formal proof that T holds” and “P is a persuasive argument for accepting T ”. Thus, in mathematical reasoning,

(a) The premises can, ultimately, be explicitly defined in terms of closed concepts, e.g. the axioms of Euclidean geometry, the Zermelo–Frankel basis for set theory (ZF). Furthermore classical mathematical reasoning is based on an assumption that such premises are, collectively, consistent. 1 (b) Reasoning and analysis takes place within a closed, tightly defined context, i.e. there is no notion of “incomplete” or “uncertain” information. (c) Conclusions are final and definite: if P is a correct proof that T , then T is, ipso facto valid and this status does not admit subsequent qualification or amendment, let alone retraction. (d) Reasoning and conclusions are entirely objective, not susceptible to rational dispute on the basis of subjective views and prejudices.2 Proof is demonstration whereas argument is persuasion.
In argument and discussion as encountered in everyday contexts, it is rare that any, let alone all, of these apply: the premises upon which debates may build are often presupposed as forming part of the background assumptions common to all parties involved; the information and knowledge brought to bear in the course of discussion will often be incomplete, vague, or uncertain. The remaining two aspects, in many ways, highlight the most significant differences between “logical proof” and “persuasive argument”. Arguments are defeasible: the reasoning that formed a persuasive case for T , in the light of changes in viewpoint or awareness of information not previously available, may subsequently fail to convince. This defeasibility is never removed: an argument may cease to be challenged and so accepted, but the possibility of challenge remains. Finally, the extent to which an argued case is accepted is subjective, dependent on the views, attitudes, and prejudices of the audiences to which it is directed. The same case may convince some people but, equally, fail to convince others.

One can summarise the distinction between argumentation and proof by the observation that the object of argumentation is to persuade (to acceptance of a given claim; to performance of a desired action, and so on). Unlike the concept of “proof”—at the level of deriving a sentential representation of an assertion—whether an argument is “correct” is not a factor, and, indeed, “correctness” may not even be sensibly defined. In contrast, mathematical reasoning, in order to have any value, must be correct where “correctness” has a strict, formal definition: beyond this requirement, however, notions of “persuasiveness” are unimportant. In summary, the importation of elements from logic and formal deductive reasoning has provided a powerful basis for modelling and analysing argumentation in computational settings of AI. As we shall discuss later, these continue to form an important strand of contemporary work. It is also the case, however, that a number of significant directions pursued in recent years, have broadened the scope and concerns of argumentation in AI beyond this earlier logic driven motivation. As a consequence, one has a shift of emphasis within the developed treatment of argumentation in AI progressing from formalisms rooted in classical deductive reasoning through models handling concepts of incomplete information and uncertainty, to precise semantics for capturing defeasibility, and, within recent work, propounding computational bases to account for subjective aspects of argumentation, often using the notion of “audience” introduced by Perelman [145]. One consequence of such analyses has been the growth of work dealing with computational procedures and issues of resource-boundedness in implementing these, e.g. as discussed in Loui [118]. All of these features make argumentation particularly attractive to applications requiring distributed intelligence, autonomous components and synchronous interaction. To conclude this overview, it is worth noting one further historical and continuing tradition. In common with many established areas of AI, the computational theory of argumentation has benefited from contributions and ideas originating in many diverse disciplines, so that a number of fundamental themes draw on the earlier work of, for example, philosophers, logicians, and legal theorists. In presenting concrete realisations of these theories, work on argumentation in AI has in its turn informed further research in these fields. Argumentation is thus an excellent example of interdisciplinary interchange and the mutual benefits that can stem from this.
