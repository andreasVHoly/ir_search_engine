A hybrid machine learning approach to network
anomaly detection

The Internet has become a part of our daily life. It is now an essential tool in surviving in the World and
aids people in many areas such as business, education and many more. Businesses in particular use the Internet
as an important component of their business model. Businesses not only use internet application such as web
and e-mail to generate revenue and communicate with their customers, but customers often use machines
accessible through the internet to store important and proprietary information. While this may help businesses
operate more efficiently, it also makes them extremely vulnerable to attacks, which include stealing data and
obstructing the operations of the business. It is common to find environments on the Internet that have few
risks in carrying out an attack. These risks are a result of the high degree of anonymity, and lackluster police
interest. However, attacks can be easily circumvented by attack prevention schemes. In order to prevent such
attacks, multitude of systems has been designed or proposed to thwart Internet-based attacks. Many of the
most commonly used systems today are based on attack signatures, which are unique patterns or conditions
that may indicate an attack. These systems may seem effective and efficient; however, there are many drawbacks
to signature-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). The first problem is that these systems
become a single point of failure. If the deployed NIDS system is disabled for any reason, then it
often gives the attacker the time needed to compromise the systems and possibly gain a foothold in the network.
Moreover if NIDS systems are not properly configured or maintained, they may provide a false sense of
security. In addition, research has shown that if the signatures are not sufficiently robust in describing the
attack conditions, then simple modifications can be made that will allow the attack to succeed [44]. Besides
the robustness of the signature, signature-based intrusion detection systems rely on human intervention to create,
test, and deploy the signatures. Thus, it may take hours or days to generate a new signature for an attack
which can be too long when dealing with rapidly moving attacks, such as worm propagation. Some effort has
been put into automatic signature generation, which does not require human intervention, but these systems
are not yet ready for large scale deployment.
In order to solve the problem mentioned above, systems that do not rely on human intervention were
invented. These are anomaly detection systems based on machine learning, data mining or statistical algorithms.
These systems use a ‘‘normal behavior’’ model for detecting unexpected behavior. These approaches
fall under two categories: supervised methods, which make use of pre-existing knowledge, and unsupervised
methods, which do not make use of this knowledge. Several efforts to design anomaly detection algorithms
using supervised methods have been discussed in [2,7,26,36].
The research of Anderson et al. [2] and Cabrera et al. [7] deal with statistical methods for intrusion detection.
Although the two researchers used the same method, the method was used in a different way. The work
of Anderson et al. [2] is a comprehensive intrusion-detection system that performs real-time monitoring of user
activity on multiple target systems connected via Ethernet. On the other hand, the statistical method of Cabrera
et al. [7] is the application of statistical traffic modeling for detecting novel attacks against computer networks.
Differing from the other researchers, Wenke Lee’s research [26] focuses on theoretical measures for
anomaly detection. His work uses several information-theoretic measures, namely, entropy, conditional
entropy, relative conditional entropy, information gain, and information cost for anomaly detection. Also,
Ryan et al. [36] uses artificial neural networks with supervised learning, based on the back-propagation neural
network, called Neural Network Intrusion Detector, was trained in the identification task and tests experimentally
on a system of 10 users. In contrast with the other methods used by researchers that are under supervised
schemes, unsupervised schemes can create automatically appropriate labels for a given dataset. Anomaly
detection methods with unsupervised features are explained in [14,15,32,33,39,46].
Among those unsupervised schemes, MINDS [14] is based on data mining and data clustering methods
such as Filtering/Preprocessing/Known attack detection module, Scan detector, Anomaly detection algorithms,
and Summarization of attacks using association pattern analysis. MINDS is still developing a suite
of data mining techniques to automatically detect attacks against computer networks and systems. Another
one of unsupervised methods, the research of Eskin et al. [15] and Portnoy et al. [32] are used to detect anomalous
attacks without pre-existing knowledge. In the case of Eskin’s research, data elements are mapped to a
feature space, which is a typically vector space, in order to process unlabelled data. Also, Portnoy presented a
new type of intrusion detection algorithm, which takes a set of unlabeled data as inputs and attempts to find

intrusion patterns within the data. The basic idea is that since the intrusions are both not normal, and are rare,
they will appear as outliers in the data. Staniford [39] is the author of SPADE for anomaly-based port scan
detection in Snort. SPADE utilizes a statistical anomaly detection method with Bayesian probability, and uses
a simulated annealing method to cluster anomalous packets together into port scans using heuristics developed
from real scans. Ramaswamy et al. [33] uses an outlier calculation with data mining to propose a novel
formulation for distance-based outliers, which is based on the distance of a point from its ‘k’ and declares the
top ‘n’ points to be outliers in this ranking calculation.
Irrespective of whether good anomaly detection methods are used, the problems such as high false alarm
rates, difficulty in finding proper features, and high performance requirements still exist. Therefore, if we are
able to mix the advantages of both learning schemes in machine learning methods, according to their characteristics
in the problem domain, then the combined approach can be used as an efficient means for detecting
anomalous attacks.
In this paper, we have chosen to focus on the Support Vector Machine (SVM) among various machine
learning algorithms. The SVM is already known as the best learning algorithm for binary classification
[5,6,12,17,20,23,28,37,40,42]. However, it is not the reason that we have chosen SVM. The most significant
reason we chose the SVM is because it can be used for either supervised or unsupervised learning. The
SVM, originally a type of pattern classifier based on a statistical learning technique for classification and
regression with a variety of kernel functions [12,23,37,42], has been successfully applied to a number of pattern
recognition applications [6]. Recently, it has also been applied to inform security for intrusion detection
[17,20,40]. Another positive aspect of SVM is that it is useful for finding a global minimum of the actual risk
using structural risk minimization, since it can generalize well with kernel tricks even in high-dimensional
spaces under little training sample conditions. The SVM can select appropriate setup parameters because it
does not depend on traditional empirical risk such as neural networks. In the case of supervised SVM learning,
it has relatively fast processing and high detection performance when compared to existing artificial neural
networks and the unsupervised SVM, as shown in [13,30]. However, one of the main disadvantages of the
supervised method is that it requires labeled information for efficient learning. Moreover, it can not deal with
the relationship between consecutive variations of learning inputs without additional preprocessing.
Therefore, we propose an Enhanced SVM approach which sits between the standard supervised SVM and
the unsupervised SVM as a core component of the hybrid machine learning approach for network anomaly
detection. The enhanced SVM approach inherits the advantages of both SVM approaches, namely high performance
and unlabelled capability. Also, additional learning and packet filtering techniques are applied to the
hybrid machine learning framework such as SOFM for profiling normal packets, PTF for filtering unknown
packets, GA for selecting more appropriate packet fields, and considering the relationship of packet sequences
in order to support the proposed SVM approach. We expect that the hybrid machine learning approach, based
on this Enhanced SVM and supplemented by the preprocessing and testing techniques described in the next
section, will demonstrate overall better performance than any previously proposed NIDS.
