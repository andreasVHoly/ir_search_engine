with Java Implementations

Introduction
The Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis
(Weka) is a comprehensive suite of Java class
libraries that implement many state-of-the-art
machine learning and data mining algorithms.
Weka is freely available on the World-Wide Web
and accompanies a new text on data mining [1]
which documents and fully explains all the
algorithms it contains. Applications written using
the Weka class libraries can be run on any
computer with a Web browsing capability; this
allows users to apply machine learning techniques
to their own data regardless of computer platform.
Tools are provided for pre-processing data, feeding
it into a variety of learning schemes, and analyzing
the resulting classifiers and their performance. An
important resource for navigating through Weka is
its on-line documentation, which is automatically
generated from the source.
The primary learning methods in Weka are
“classifiers”, and they induce a rule set or decision
tree that models the data. Weka also includes
algorithms for learning association rules and
clustering data. All implementations have a
uniform command-line interface. A common
evaluation module measures the relative
performance of several learning algorithms over a
given data set.
Tools for pre-processing the data, or “filters,” are
another important resource. Like the learning
schemes, filters have a standardized command-line
interface with a set of common command-line
options.
The Weka software is written entirely in Java to
facilitate the availability of data mining tools
regardless of computer platform. The system is, in
sum, a suite of Java packages, each documented to
provide developers with state-of-the-art facilities.

Conclusions
As the technology of machine learning continues to
develop and mature, learning algorithms need to be
brought to the desktops of people who work with
data and understand the application domain from
which it arises. It is necessary to get the algorithms
out of the laboratory and into the work
environment of those who can use them. Weka is a
significant step in the transfer of machine learning
technology into the workplace.
