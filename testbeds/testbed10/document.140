The World Wide Web (Web) is a popular and interactive
medium to disseminate information today. The Web is huge,
diverse, and dynamic and thus raises the scaiability, multimedia
data, and temporal issues respectively. Due to those
situations, we are currently drowning in information and
facing information overload [86]. Information users could
encounter, among others, the following problems when interacting
with the Web:
a. Finding relevant information: People either browse or
use the search service when they want to find specific information
on the Web. When a user uses search service he
or she usually inputs a simple keyword query and the query
response is the list of pages ranked based on their similarity
to the query. However today's search tools have the following
problems [23]. The first problem is low precision, which
is due to the irrelevance of many of the search results. This
results in a difficulty finding the relevant information. The
second problem is low recall, which is due to the inability
to index all the information available on the Web. This results
in a difficulty finding the unindexed information that
is relevant. See [81] for some other search engine problems.
b. Creating new knowledge out of the information available
on the Web: Actually this problem could be regarded as a
sub-problem of the problem above. While the problem above
is usually a query-triggered process (retrieval oriented), this
problem is a data-triggered process that presumes that we
already have a collection of Web data and we want to extract
potentially useful knowledge out of it (data mining
oriented). Recent research [34; 85; 29] focuses on utilizing
the Web as a knowledge base for decision making.
c. Personalization of the information: This problem is often
associated with the type and presentation of information,
since it is likely that people differ in the contents and presentations
they prefer while interacting with the Web.
On the other hand, the information providers could encounter
these problems, among others, when trying to achieve
their goals on the Web:
d. Learning about consumers or individual users: This is
a problem that specifically deals with the problem c above,
which is about knowing what the customers do and want.
Inside this problem, there are sub-problems such as mass
customizing the information to the intended consumers or
even to personalize it to individual user, problems related to
effective Web site design and management, problems related
to marketing, etc.
Web mining techniques could be used to solve the information
overload problems above directly or indirectly. However,
we do not claim that Web mining techniques are the
only tools to solve those problems. Other techniques and
works from different research areas, such as database (DB),
information retrieval (IR), natural language processing (NLP)
and the Web document community, could also be used. By
the direct approach we mean that the application of the Web
mining techniques directly addresses the above problems.
For example, a Newsgroup agent that classifies whether the
news is relevant to the user. By the indirect approach we
mean that the Web mining techniques are used as a part
of a bigger application that addresses the above problems.
For example, Web mining techniques could be used to create
index terms for the Web search services.
The Web mining research is a converging research area from
several research communities, such as database, IR, and AI
research communities especially from machine learning and
NLP. This paper is an attempt to put the research done in
a more structured way from the machine learning point of
view. However, the methods of the research that we survey
do not necessarily use well-known machine learning algorithms. Since this is a huge, interdisciplinary, and very
dynamic research area, there are undoubtedly some omissions
in our coverage.
This paper is structured as follows. In section 2 we give
an overview of Web mining, describe some confusions in the
usage of the term Web mining, provide a classification, and
relate this classification to the agent paradigm. In section 3,
4 and 5 we describe some research that represent the range
of the research in their respective categories. In section 6 we
discuss some related work and finally we conclude in section
7.
