The development of computer supported systems for melanoma diagnosis is of increasing importance: on the one hand, clinical accuracy of dermatologists in identifying malignant melanomas is only between 65 [2] and 85% [17]. On the other hand, one is faced with a world-wide increase of the incidence of malignant melanoma [10]. Several approaches to computer supported melanoma diagnosis are based on color images making use of image analysis methods to quantify visual features as described by the ‘ABCD’-rule (Asymmetry, irregular Border, varying Color, Diameter) [14,16,39]. Laser profilometry opens up new possibilities to improve tumor diagnostics in dermatology [18,42]. With a laser profilometer, skin surfaces with an area of 4×4 mm2 are taken at a resolution of 125 sample points per mm and a vertical resolution of 0.1 mm. Since surface sampling at this high resolution takes several hours, skin surface structures are preserved as silicone rubber imprints. The superior reflection characteristic of the silicon rubber is another reason to use imprints. Taking 125 samples per mm with a measuring interval of 8 mm results in a profile with 500×500 sample points, finally. Profiles are displayed using lambert shading technique [12] to visualize even fine surface structures of the lesions (Fig. 1). The recognition task is to classify surface profiles of melanomas and nevi, also called moles. In a clinical study, surface profiles of 19 superficial spreading melanomas from 19 patients and 25 nevocytic nevi from 23 patients were analyzed. Most of the examined nevi were clinically atypical [5,27]. All diagnoses were confirmed histologically by at least two investigators. Due to the fact that all profiles contain regions with a structure similar to normal skin (like e.g. seen in Fig. 1, upper right), each profile is subdivided into 16 non overlapping quadratic sub-profiles and image analysis algorithms are applied to each sub-profile separately. In the next step, feature selection algorithms are applied to optimize the classification performance of the recognition system. This is motivated by the occurrence of a peaking phenomenon that is often observed in pattern recognition systems when finite sets of training samples are used to build classifiers [6,22,23]. Although theoretically the introduction of additional features can never decrease the classification rate (=1-error rate) of the optimal Bayes classifier, adding new features to a feature set often leads to a decreasing classification rate of a classifier as trained on a limited set of samples. Genetic algorithms as well as heuristic strategies and greedy algorithms are used for feature selection. Finally, several architectures of feed forward neural networks trained with error back-propagation are evaluated for the recognition task. 2. Feature extraction Three types of features are extracted to describe profile structures quantitatively: Texture parameters based on cooccurrence matrices as proposed in [19], features calculated from the Fourier power spectrum of the profiles as described in [3] and fractal features [11,16,31]. The application of texture analysis methods based on cooccurrence matrices [19] is motivated by the observation that textures can be characterized by the cooccurrence of its gray values. The cooccurrence matrix Sd, u of a profile f is calculated as follows: A matrix element Sd, u(i, j ) is given as the relative frequency of cooccurrence of gray levels gi and gj in the spatial neighborhood described by displacement vector (d, U) with direction U and distance d and f(x1, y1)=gif(x2, y2)=gj with (x2, y2)=(x1+d cos u, y1d sin u) (1) Skin profile altitude values range between −869 mm and +381.65 mm with reference to a zero line. To calculate cooccurrence matrix entries, altitude values are normalized into 64 intervals with equal interval lengths. To assure rotation invariance of the texture features, cooccurrence matrices Sd, uk for eight discrete angles uk=kp/4, k=1,…, 8 are computed and a rotation invariant cooccurrence matrix is generated as follows [15]: S(d(i, j)=1 8 % 7 k=0 S(d, p/4 k) (i, j). (2) Due to the observation that texture patterns may vary strongly in scale, several rotation invariant cooccurrence matrices with d=1, 3, 6, 10 and 16 are computed. From each matrix, 13 texture features hi d (i=1,…, 13) as proposed in [19] are extracted. The second approach quantifies textural information of skin surface profiles in the Fourier power spectrum [3]. Let F(u, 6) denote the Fourier transform of the two-dimensional signal function f(x, y) and its power spectrum given by
