The importance of word-of-mouth has been widely documented in the existing literature (Anderson, 1998; Goldenberg, Libai, & Muller, 2001; Zhu & Zhang, 2006; Stokes & Lomax, 2002). Although its definition could be slightly varied, the term wordof-mouth generally refers to the personal communications between individuals concerning the perception of goods and services. Anderson (1998) stated that unsatisfied customers do engage in great word-of-mouth than satisfied ones. However, Stokes and Lomax (2002) argued that improved word-of-mouth communications can be an effective marketing strategy for small hospitality businesses. Similarly, Goldenberg et al. (2001) claimed that consumers’ decision making process is strongly influenced by wordof-mouth. As such, word-of-mouth communications at the microlevel can influence macro-level phenomena. Recently, the unprecedented growth of Internet applications to travel and tourism has generated a plethora of new opportunities and challenges to consumers and practitioners. Among these new opportunities, the Internet provides a virtual environment for consumers to share their experiences with world-wide travelers via the electronic word-of-mouth communication channel (Pan, MacLaurin, & Crotts, 2007). Zhu and Zhang (2006) as well as Cheung, Shek, and Sia (2004) examined people’s behavior for contributing in the virtual community, and stated that such a behavior would be beneficial to consumers and managers. Likewise, Dellarocas (2003) claimed that online word-of-mouth can have important implications for managers to consider their brand building, product development, and quality assurance. In brief, the Internet can serve as a useful platform for personal communications on sharing information of ownership, particular goods and services, and the suppliers and the place of supply. Travel blogs are a form of digital story telling or word-of-mouth, which are self-published to disseminate travel narratives and adventures (Pan et al., 2007; Pudliner, 2007). In recent years, the wide application of the Internet to tourism has resulted in the availability of a huge amount of travel blogs for publicizing travel-related information. For instance, an attempt of using searching for ‘‘Travel Blog” on Google can often return 300 million pages. According to DoubleClick Inc. (2005), travelers generally tend to conduct an online search about their preferred destinations prior to making travel decisions (DoubleClick, 2005). When viewing travel blogs, the electronic word-of-mouth effect exerts a strong force that can influence the final decision of customers as well as tourism managers. Consumers can read, and subsequently use, the reviews as references to determine whether a place is their preferred destination. Although the information available on travel blogs could be of use, it is basically not possible for anyone to manually read the thousands, if not millions, of travel blogs. As such, sophisticated sentiment classification techniques that can automatically classify, on the basis of the analyzed travel blogs, whether the overall reviews of a specific destination are positive or negative would certainly be useful to users. Sentiment classification is a class of recently developed web mining techniques that can perform analysis on sentiment or opinions (Liu, Hu, & Cheng, 2005; Morinaga, Yamanishi, Tateishi, & Fukushima, 2002; Pang, Lee, & Vaithyanathan, 2002; Turney, 2002). Generally speaking, sentiment classification aims at mining text of written reviews from customers for certain products or services, and classifying the reviews into positive or negative opinions. The classification method has been applied to the computing fields of information retrieval and natural language processing ( Beineke, Hastie, & Vaithyanathan, 2004; Godbole, Srinivasaiah, & Skiena, 2007; Pang et al., 2002; Turney & Littman, 2003). Special challenges are associated with mining on tourist reviews. In this domain specific area, word semantics in a particular review could contradict with the overall semantic direction (good or bad) of that review. For instance, an ‘‘unpredictable” camera implies negative meaning to that camera; whereas a tour with an ‘‘unpredictable” experience is positive to explorers. Although some recent studies have begin to conduct content analysis of travel blogs (Choi, Lehto, & Morrison, 2007; Pan et al., 2007), sophisticated web mining technique still need to be integrated into travel blog analysis. To fill in this void in the existing tourism literature, this study makes an attempt to perform automatic classifications based on the sentiment attitudes of online reviews with regards to travel destinations. Additionally, this study compares different supervised machine learning algorithms and their effect on the different amount of training corpus to various performance measurements in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall in the sentiment classification of online reviews about tourist destinations. In this study, three supervised machine learning algorithms, including Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and the character based N-gram model were incorporated into sentiment classification for the reviews about seven popular travel destinations in Europe and North America. These destinations included New York, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, London, Rome, Paris, and Venice.
