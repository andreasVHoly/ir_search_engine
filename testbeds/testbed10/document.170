AI and machine learning techniques for managing complexity,
changes and uncertainties in manufacturing


Laszl ! o Monostori*

1. Introduction
Growing complexity is one of the most significant
characteristics of today’s manufacturing, which is
manifested not only in manufacturing systems, but also
the products to be manufactured, in the processes, and
the company structures (Wiendahl and Scholtissek,
1994). The systems operate in a changing environment
life with uncertainty.
The term of Intelligent Manufacturing Systems
(IMSs) can be attributed to a tentative forecast of
Hatvany and Nemes (1978). In another landmark paper
of Hatvany (1983), IMSs were outlined as the next
generation of manufacturing systems that—utilising the
results of the Artificial intelligence (AI) research—were
expected to solve, within certain limits, unprecedented,
unforeseen problems on the basis of even incomplete
and imprecise information (Hatvany, 1983).
The most frequently cited definition of learning comes
from Simon (1983): ‘‘Learning denotes changes in the
system that is adaptive in the sense that they enable the
system to do the same task or tasks drawn from the
same population more effectively the next time’’. With
respect to advanced engineering automation, as stated in
Lu(1990), ‘‘we need new computer technologies that cannot only generate, record, and retrieve information,
but also digest and synthesise information into knowledge
and represent this knowledge properly to support
decision-making’’. It can be emphasised that intelligence
is strongly connected with learning, and learning ability
must be an indispensable feature of IMSs (Monostori
et al., 1996).
The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2
gives a short survey of AI and machine learning (ML)
techniques available. Approaches to handling changes
and uncertainties in the process/machine level are
treated in Section 3. System level issues are addressed
in Section 4, while Section 5 attempts to draw some
conclusions and to highlight some future research
directions. learning techniques to get closer to working IMSs. In
correspondence with a recently published larger survey
on ML approaches to manufacturing (Monostori et al.,
1996), the following main trends can be enumerated:
* attributable mostly to the results of ANN research—
in contrast to the situation 8–10 years ago, when they
were considered as fields hardly manageable with AI
techniques—the area of process modelling, monitoring
and control came to the fore;
* in recent years ANN-based learning is the dominant
ML technique in manufacturing;
* ANNs are natural tools at lower levels of IMs where
abilities of sensor integration, signal processing,
uncertainty handling, real-time and adaptive functioning
are required, but
* ANNs find their applications on nearly every, also on
non-sensory domains of manufacturing, as general
information processing blocks with learning abilities;
* development and routine production of programmable
ANN chips (e.g., cellular neural networks
(Roska and Rodriguez-Vazquez, 2000) will give a
new, spectacular impulse to ANN applications in
manufacturing, especially with the rapid spread of
smart sensors;
* neuro-fuzzy approaches manifest themselves as prospective
tools of numerous problems in manufacturing
where real-time nature, learning ability, handling
of uncertainty and both symbolic and numeric
information are essential requirements;
* as the considerable number of projects with multistrategy
learning methods shows, the future belongs
to these integrated approaches (Egresits et al., 1998).
Distributed, holonic-like systems represent viable
alternatives to hierarchical and heterarchical structures
and the corresponding reactive scheduling approaches.
Both of these—apparently distinct—lines can be advantageously
used in rapidly changing production
environments, however, none of them can be regarded
as a universal tool. Even the application of such
powerful global optimisation techniques as GAs, are
not appropriate for very large problems, and as
centralised approaches, are not totally devoid of all
the known drawbacks of centralised/hierarchical control
systems (Monostori et al., 1998). The multi-agent
approach also becomes unrealistic beyond a given
problem size, first of all due to the rapidly increasing
communication burden. Consequently, both directions
crave for some kind of aggregation (Van Brussel et al.,
1998). There is a scope for temporal or permanent
hierarchies also in holonic architectures (Bongaerts et al.,
2000). By this way, the amount of necessary communication
can be decreased, and the holonic concept can
be expanded to the level of extended or virtual
enterprises.
A fundamental issue in distributed systems is how to
ensure global performance with selfish agents pursuing
their own goals (Hatvany, 1985). The integration of
scheduling agents as a kind of staff holons (Van Brussel
et al., 1998) into the architecture, can contribute to
achieving global coherence in distributed systems
(Monostori et al., 1998).
The object-oriented simulation framework described
in the paper, is expected to provide the necessary
framework for further research addressing such
fundamental issues of distributed manufacturing as
agent structures, communication protocols, group formation,
negotiation, global versus local optima, scalability,
system tuning, agents’ behaviour, learning at
system and agent levels (Monostori et al., 1996).
The further integration of more traditional AI
and ML techniques with the agent-based approach in
the field of intelligent machines can be predicted
resulting in systems with emergent behaviour (Ueda
et al., 2001).
