I. INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND, AND RELATED WORK
WE begin this paper, to paraphrase the popular song,
at the very beginning in consideration of the interdisciplinary
audience that is the target of this issue. Neural
networks (NN’s) represent a computational [36] approach to
intelligence as contrasted with the traditional, more symbolic
approaches. The idea of such systems is due to the work of the
psychologist D. Hebb [20] (and after whom a class of learning
techniques is referred to as Hebbian). Despite the pioneering
early work of McCullouch and Pitts [39] and Rosenblatt [51],
the field was largely ignored through most of 1960’s and
1970’s, with researchers in artificial intelligence (AI) mostly
concentrating on symbolic techniques. Reasons for this could
be the lack of appropriate computational hardware or the work
of Minsky and Papert which showed limitations of a class of
NN’s (single layer perceptrons) popular then. The failure of
good old-fashioned AI (GOFAI) [5], the development of very
large-scale integration (VLSI) and parallel computing revived
interest in NN’s in the mid 1980’s as an alternate mechanism to
investigate, understand, and duplicate intelligence. In the past decade, there has been a phenomenal growth in the published
literature in this field, and a large number of conferences are
now held in the area [36].
Some researchers view NN’s as mechanisms to study intelligence
(e.g., the famous text by McClelland and Rumelhart
[53]), but most literature in the area sees NN’s as a
tool to solve problems in science and engineering. Most of
these problems involve pattern recognition (PR) in one form
or another—everything from speech recognition to image
recognition to SAR/Sonar data classification to stock market
tracking, and so on. The paper by Jain et al. [24] elaborates
upon this viewpoint. These problems involve both classi-
fication (supervised learning) and clustering (unsupervised
learning). Recently, many researchers have investigated the
links between NN-based techniques and traditional statistical
pattern recognition techniques. One of the first efforts in this
direction was the seminal text by Jain and Sethi [57]. Since
then, this topic has aroused considerable interest and has seen
many discussions—some acrimonious, between those who feel
that NN’s are old wine in new bottles, and those who feel
that they represent a new paradigm. As any follower of the
news group comp.ai.neural-nets knows, this debate occurs
there almost every six months, often triggered by an innocent 
question from a “newbie.”

VII. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper, we have described two hybrid neuro-fuzzy
schemes—one for pattern classification and the other for
clustering. Both these schemes utilize fuzzy hyperboxes to
represent pattern classes. The clustering scheme is motivated
by the human visual system. These schemes were extensively compared with traditional, statistical, neural and machine
learning algorithms by experimenting with real-world data
sets. The classification algorithm performs as well as some of
the better algorithms discussed here like—C4.5, IB, OC1, and
Rprop. Besides, this algorithm has the ability to provide online
adaptation. The clustering algorithm borrows ideas from
computer vision to partition the pattern space in a hierarchical
manner. It has been found that this simple technique yields
very good results. It was seen that the performance of this
algorithm is very good on clustering real world data sets.
We feel that our clustering scheme provides good support
for pattern recognition applications in real-world domains.
Our detailed experiments also indicate that regardless of the
underlying paradigm, the more sophisticated methods tended
to out perform the simpler ones. Moreover, the best methods
from each paradigm perform about as well as one another,
with minor variations depending on the nature of the data.
Our neuro–fuzzy techniques are important in this respect, since
they tend to be amongst the best performing methods, and have
the added advantage of single-pass learning.
