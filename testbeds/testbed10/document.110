Introduction P REDICTIVE ABILITY is considered by many to be the ultimate goal in ecology (Peters 1991). Recent decades have witnessed an increasing role of prediction in applied ecology, in large part because of the mounting threats to biological diversity from global environmental change and the resulting need for ecological forecasting (Clark et al. 2001). Such efforts, however, are hindered by the many complexities of ecosystems, including historical legacies, time lags, nonlinearities, interactions, and feedback loops that vary in both time and space (Levin 1998). Accordingly, ecologists are challenged by the need to understand and predict complex ecological processes and patterns. One promising set of quantitative tools that can help solve such environmental challenges (e.g., global climate change, emerging diseases, biodiversity loss) is currently being researched and developed under the rubric of ecological informatics (Green et al. 2005). Ecological informatics, or eco-informatics, is an interdisciplinary framework that promotes the use of advanced computational technology to reveal ecological processes and patterns across levels of ecosystem complexity (Recknagel 2003). Machine learning (ML) is a rapidly growing area of eco-informatics that is concerned with identifying structure in complex, often nonlinear data and generating accurate predictive models. Recent advances in data collection technology, such as remote-sensing and data network centers and archives, have produced large, high-resolution datasets spanning spatial and temporal extents that were, until recently, unattainable. As a result, ecologists have the exciting opportunity to take advantage of ML approaches to model the complex relationships inherent in these large datasets. Applications of ML methods in ecology are diverse, and range from testing biogeographical, ecological, and evolutionary hypotheses to modeling species distributions for conservation and management planning (e.g., Fielding 1999; Recknagel 2001, 2003; Cushing and Wilson 2005; Ferrier and Guisan 2006; Park and Chon 2007). ML algorithms can be organized according to a diverse taxonomy that reflects the desired outcome of the modeling process. A number of ML techniques have been promoted in ecology as powerful alternatives to traditional modeling approaches. These include supervised learning approaches that attempt to model the relationship between a set of inputs and known outputs, such as artificial neural networks (Lek et al. 1996), cellular automata (Hogeweg 1988), classification and regression trees (De’ath and Fabricius 2000), fuzzy logic (Salski and Sperlbaum 1991), genetic algorithms and programming (Stockwell and Noble 1992), maximum entropy (Phillips et al. 2006), support vector machines (Drake et al. 2006), and wavelet analysis (Cho and Chon 2006). In addition, unsupervised learning approaches are used to reveal patterns in ecological data, including Hop- field neural networks (Hopfield 1982) and self-organizing maps (Kohonen 2001). The growing use of these methods in recent years is the direct result of their ability to model complex, nonlinear relationships in ecological data without having to satisfy the restrictive assumptions required by conventional, parametric approaches (Guisan and Zimmermann 2000; Peterson and Vieglais 2001; Olden and Jackson 2002a; Elith et al. 2006). As a result, ML approaches often exhibit greater power for explaining and predicting ecological patterns. The recent formation of The International Society for Ecological Informatics, as well as the birth of the scientific journal Ecological Informatics supports the observation that ML has evolved from a field of theoretical demonstrations to one of significant and applied value in ecology. Perhaps not surprisingly, ML approaches are predominantly used by ecologists with strong computational skills, and they have seen only limited use within the broader scientific community. Why have ML approaches not been widely embraced by ecologists? One reason is that ecologists may lack the fundamental background needed to understand and implement these methods, and they may be unsure about how to select approaches that best suit their needs. At the same time, researchers in the field of ecological informatics continue to advance better and more complex ML algorithms, arguing that more powerful computers and increased availability of large ecological data sets will move them further into the mainstream. Unfortunately, as the technology in ML grows, so does the inaccessibility of these techniques to the majority of ecologists who still require a basic understanding of why, when, where, and how such approaches should be applied. We argue that there are relatively few examples in the ecological literature that encourage the exploration and promote the application of ML methods. In this paper, we will address this concern by providing a comprehensive review of three ML methods that have recently gained popularity among ecologists: classification and regression trees, artificial neural networks, and evolutionary computation (genetic algorithms and programming); however, we recognize that other statistical approaches, including generalized additive models and multivariate adaptive regression splines, have also illustrated utility in ecology (e.g., Austin 2007; Elith and Leathwick 2007). For each approach, we will provide a brief background to the methodology, give examples of its application in ecology, describe model development and implementation, discuss strengths and weaknesses, and explore the availability of statistical software. In order to more clearly illustrate the basic principles of the ML methodolo gies, we will apply each method to a common ecological question, namely modeling species richness (dependent variable) as a function of environmental descriptors (independent variables). We stress that our review is not meant to replace previously published texts on ML (e.g., Fielding 1999; Lek and Gue´gan 2000), rather it is intended to provide a gentle introduction to ML methods that is more readily accessible to the broad community of ecologists. We accomplish this by favoring written explanation over mathematical formulas and by avoiding statistical jargon that often serves to limit the readership and comprehension of ML methodologies by ecologists. Put simply, our hope is that this paper will encourage a greater understanding and the future application of ML approaches in the ecological sciences.
