Background Our understanding of ecological systems is inadequate because our knowledge is based on very limited spatial and temporal scales (Levin, 1992; Condit, 1995; Porter et al., 2005). New advances in satellite imaging and sensor networks have provided invaluable tools for collecting land-cover and abiotic data over larger scales; however, collecting biodiversity data, especially for fauna is still limited due to the need for species identification by humans. Recent developments in computer science for pattern recognition and classification are providing new tools to meet this challenge. Most classification methods used for the automated identification of species classify samples based on morphological characteristics (Gauld et al., 2000) or bioacoustic signals (Brandes et al., 2006; Nickerson et al., 2006; Fagerlund, 2007). Classification of samples based on morphological characteristics requires the collection of the organism or portions of the organism (such as wings, pollen or genitalia) which requires intensive field sampling. However, sound can be collected easily in the field through automated digital recorders, which can collect data continuously and have the ability to detect more species than traditional scientific surveys (Acevedo and Villanueva-Rivera, 2006). Furthermore, these recordings can be analyzed with classification methods to automate species identification. The two most important tasks in the process of automated species identification with sound are signal detection and signal characterization (Rickwood and Taylor, 2008). Signal detection refers to the extraction of vocalizations of interest from the noisy environment of a continuous recording. Signal characterization refers to the classification of these extracted vocalizations into species. Signal detection has been well studied for human speech recognition; however, even though multiple classification methods have been applied for signal characterization, few studies have compared the precision and accuracy of these methods (Skowronski and Harris, 2006). Many studies argue that supervised machine learning algorithms such as linear discriminant analysis (Simmonds et al., 1996; Parsons and Jones, 2000), decision trees (Herr et al., 1997), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) (Balfoort et al., 1992; Boddy et al., 1994; Do et al., 1999; Chesmore et al., 2001), Hidden Markov Chains (Kogan and Margoliash, 1998) and support vector machines (SVMs) (Fagerlund, 2007) are the best choice for automated species identification becauseof their high accuracy (N90% accuracy) when compared to human classification. The major disadvantage of these algorithms is that they require large numbers of samples (hundreds to thousands) to train the system to obtain this high accuracy. Moreover, the training stage of most of these supervised ML algorithms is computationally demanding due to the large amount of data used as input. Thus, there is a need for new ways to reduce the amount of data used for training without compromising precision or accuracy. The objectives of this study are (1) to compare three machine learning algorithms (linear discriminant analysis, decision tree and support vector machine) in the automated classification of bird and amphibian calls and (2) to compare two methods of training data reduction, one that characterizes each call with four standard variables (minimum and maximum frequencies, call duration and maximum power) and another that included 11 call variables (minimum frequency, maximum frequency, call duration and the frequency of maximum power in eight segments of the call). To make these comparisons we used 2132 recordings from Puerto Rico that include nine species of Eleutherodactylus frogs and three birds.

6. Conclusion We compared three machine learning algorithms (LDA, DT and SVM) for the automated classification of bird and amphibian calls. The SVM had the highest accuracy (highest true positive and lowest false positive rates) for most of the species. SVM, as well as other machine learning algorithms, requires large amounts of data to be trained to attain high levels of accuracy. Training SVM with digital sound files (which may contain thousands of data points) results in a computationally demanding method, however, we provide an alternate method of training data reduction that characterizes each species with 11 call variables (minimum frequency and maximum frequency, maximum power, call duration and frequency in the highest energy point in 8 segments of the call). This efficient data reduction technique in conjunction with the high classification accuracy of the SVM is a promising combination in automated species identification by sound, which if coupled with ADRS can increase the temporal and spatial coverage of biodiversity data collection.
