1. Introduction The Manila clam Ruditapes philippinarum (Adam and Reeve, 1850), which is of Indo-Pacific origin, was introduced in the Venice lagoon (Fig. 1) in the 80s as a culture species (Cesari and Pellizzato, 1985) and radically changed the exploitation of living resources in the lagoon. Within a few years, R. philippinarum became the most important exploited species in the lagoon, with a production reaching a peak of over 40,000 t y−1 at the end of the 90s, estimated from various sources and using expert knowledge by Pellizzato and Da Ros (2005). No official fishery landings data for the whole lagoon is available and yield potential is largely unknown, despite the relevant social, economic and environmental consequence of the exploitation activities. Since the introduction, the exploitation of R. philippinarum has been carried out in a regime of free access. In 1999, the Provinceof Venice began a gradual shift to a concession regime, i.e., to a system where harvesting areas are divided by the regulatory agency among a number of concessions, each managed by local clam fishermen under a strict set of rules on access limitation and exploitation effort. Technically, concessions are divided in farming (i.e., where clams are seeded) and fishing (i.e., where clams are naturally recruited) areas. In the following, we will use the word concession without further differentiating between farming and fishing areas. In 2007, about 42 km2 of the Venice lagoon were given in concession to fishermen for harvesting of R. philippinarum (Fig. 2a and Table 1). However, the transition from uncontrolled fishing to a “culturebased fishery” based on correct and sustainable rearing procedures, while being successful in reducing production of R. philippinarum, revealed to be more complex than expected and cannot be considered successfully completed (Pellizzato and Da Ros, 2005). The Province of Venice is willing to reduce the number of fishermen operating in the lagoon (from about 900 to 600) and to remodel and reduce the areas given in concession to clam fishermen (G.R.A.L., 2006, 2009; Province of Venice, 2009) to reduce health risks linked to industrial pollutants or urban waste, minimize the environmental impacts of bottom dredging, such as the loss of sediments (e.g., Molinaroli et al., 2007), increase of water turbidity and movements of nutrients and pollutants (Pranovi et al., 2004; Sfriso et al., 2005), protect habitats of conservation concern, such as seagrass meadows (Fig. 2c), and maximize production in order to minimize fishing effort, both in space and time.
