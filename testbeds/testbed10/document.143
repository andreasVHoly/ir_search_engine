1. Introduction
Lidar remote sensing of canopies far goes beyond the proof-of-concept phase and thus far has become a well-established tool for monitoring terrestrial ecosystems, with great potential for continued technological advances (Reutebuch et al., 2005). Commercial airborne lidar systems currently available, for example, can easily reach a pulse repetition frequency of more than 100 kHz and some are even able to simultaneously manipulate multiple pulses in the air. Compared to traditional remote sensing such as multispectral imaging and radar, lidar (especially small-footprint airborne laser scanner) provides superior capabilities for accurately measuring vegetation structure with no apparent sign of saturation in predicting high biomass and leaf area index (LAI) over dense forests (Koch, 2010). Such advantages spur the increasing availability and widespread use of lidar data in canopy studies, which, on the other hand, connotes the growing importance of reliable vegetation information in practical and scientific applications such as natural resource inventory and more interestingly, studies of vegetation responses and functioning in a changing climate (Hurtt et al., 2004). An early review of basic lidar principles in the context of forestry applications is given in Lim et al. (2003b).

The recent use of lidar for characterizing forest landscapes encompasses a wide array of applications targeted at estimating various vegetation structural parameters across a range of scales (van Leeuwen & Nieuwenhuis, 2010). These biophysical parameters include, but are not limited to, individual tree dimension variables such as height, crown width, crown base height, crown volume, and diameter at breast height (dbh) (Coops et al., 2004, Popescu and Wynne, 2004, Falkowski et al., 2006, Kato et al., 2009 and Popescu and Zhao, 2008), and at the canopy level, canopy height, fractional vegetation cover, LAI, total aboveground biomass and component biomass, basal area, timber volume, and canopy fuel parameters such as canopy base height, available canopy fuel, canopy bulk density and coarse wood debris (Andersen et al., 2005, Holmgren et al., 2003, Jensen et al., 2008, Næsset, 2002 and Zhao et al., 2009). Meanwhile, some studies used lidar to examine ecological roles of vegetation for various purposes. For example, Quirino et al. (2009) assessed the power of lidar-derived variables for directly predicting soil respiration at several sites in a Virginia forest. Cook et al. (2009) modeled plant productivity through the combined use of vegetation variables derived from lidar and Quickbird. A recent study by Falkowski et al. (2009) successfully classified forest succession stages in a complex, mixed coniferous forest using lidar metrics. There also are several lidar studies that derived useful indices for mapping wildlife habitat and evaluating habitat suitability, especially for many endangered species (Hyde et al., 2006). Overall, past experiences with forestry applications accentuate the great potential of lidar for remotely measuring canopy structures (Koch, 2010 and van Leeuwen and Nieuwenhuis, 2010). Moreover, part of these studies clearly articulate the virtues of integrating lidar with other remote sensing data such as multispectral images (Erdogy & Moskal, 2010), high-resolution (Mutlu et al., 2008) or hyperspectral images, and radar backscattering data (Hyde et al., 2006), although a few studies point out that for estimating some vegetation variables like LAI, the gain from the combined use of lidar and multispectral data is only marginal compared to the use of lidar alone (Jensen et al., 2008;Zhao & Popescu, 2009), possibly due to the insufficiency of statistical models used (Zhao & Popescu, 2009).

Regarding the processing and analysis of lidar data for canopy information extraction, lidar users generally keep two aprons, one laden with computational tools borrowed from disciplines such as signal/image processing and pattern recognition (Falkowski et al., 2006, Kato et al., 2009, Meng et al., 2009, Pang et al., 2008 and Popescu and Zhao, 2008), and another apron stocked with statistical analysis tools for inferring relationships and making prediction (Andersen et al., 2005, García et al., 2010, Næsset et al., 2005, van Aardt et al., 2006 and Zhao et al., 2009). The boundary between the two classes of tools is not dichotomous and often, their use is complementary as has been previously demonstrated (Popescu et al., 2002). A typical example within the first class of tools is segmenting lidar point clouds or more frequently, canopy height models for individual tree crown delineation, of which maximum filtering, template matching, k-means clustering, and the watershed transform are common algorithms (Falkowski et al., 2006, Pang et al., 2008 and Popescu et al., 2003). Other studies customized computer algorithms to directly derive crown base height and dbh of individual trees from lidar point clouds (Kato et al., 2009 and Popescu and Zhao, 2008). In contrast, the vast majority of lidar research on canopy structural characteristics is built upon the use of statistical tools taken from the second apron, and of particular importance therein is not only the selection of appropriate statistical procedures (e.g., models) but more important, the choice of effective lidar predictors (i.e., metrics) (Lefsky et al., 2005, McRoberts et al., 2010 and Næsset, 2002). Typically, lidar metrics from discrete-return data are obtained in a bookkeeping manner by first enumerating all the points within an analysis unit (e.g., grid, plot, or stand) to select part or all of the lidar points and then computing the desired statistics as metrics from the selected lidar points (Næsset et al., 2005 and Reutebuch et al., 2005). Common lidar metrics include mean, median, maximum and percentile heights, canopy density metrics, truncated mean height, quadratic mean height, variance in height, coefficient of variation, etc. (Erdogy and Moskal, 2010, Lim and Treitz, 2004 and Næsset et al., 2005). These metrics are not equally predictive for estimating a given canopy variable; then, statistical procedures come into play to determine which metrics should enter models. This paradigm is typical of many lidar applications in canopy studies (Næsset, 2002).

The large data volume and high dimensionality of lidar point clouds preclude their direct use as input to statistical models, thereby stressing the necessity to reduce and synthesize raw lidar data into various metrics at a spatial resolution commensurate with the analysis unit (Andersen et al., 2005, García et al., 2010 and Reutebuch et al., 2005). In such a sense, the conversion of lidar point clouds into metrics can be considered as some encoders that, on one hand, transform raw lidar data into a consistent format reconciliatory with statistical models and on the other hand, reduce the dimensions of lidar point data to a manageable degree. Apparently, this encoding process involves two conflicting goals — maintaining a parsimony of lidar metrics versus preserving as much information inherent in the raw lidar data as possible. To select metrics for estimating a canopy variable, one usually follows practical guides such as the physical linkage of metrics to the variable in question, the avoidance of multi-collinearity, and the optimization of certain statistical measures like R-squared, the Akaike information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion (García et al., 2010 and Lim and Treitz, 2004Roberts et al., 2005). Recently, Zhao et al. (2009) proposed the use of lidar-derived canopy height profile (CHP) in functional models to estimate forest biomass. In analogy to a hyperspectral spectrum, this metric is a discretized curve representing the vertical distribution of lidar heights over canopies and thus, it tends to retain more information of raw lidar data than many commonly used lidar metrics. However, due to its high-dimensionality and the inherent correlation between its components, CHP needs to be used in dedicated models like the functional model of Zhao et al. (2009). Alternatively, advanced supervised learning techniques such as machine leaning may be referred because of their usefulness in tackling high-dimensional problems, as confirmed by earlier studies pertaining to hyperspectral/multi-angular remote sensing (Durbha et al., 2007 and Zhao et al., 2008).

The superior performances of machine learning over classical methods have been demonstrated in a preponderance of comparative research for general remote sensing applications (Durbha et al., 2007, van der Heijden et al., 2004 and Zhao et al., 2008). For the past few decades, machine learning has been an active research field yielding a rich set of computer tools aimed to discover patterns and relationships in data (Evgeniou et al., 2000). For example, recent advances in kernel machines promote the novel use of Gaussian processes for Bayesian-based supervised learning (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006 and Zhao et al., 2008). All these machine learning tools, which continue to evolve and expand, generally provide more powers in capturing the implicit, potentially nonlinear and complex relationships between dependent and independent variables (Evgeniou et al., 2000), that is, a problem typical of many information extraction tasks in remote sensing (Næsset et al., 2005), but thus far, the use of machine learning for estimating canopy structural variables in lidar remote sensing remains rather limited (Zhao et al., 2009).

The overall purpose of this study is to explore effective methods for characterizing canopy structure using small-footprint discrete-return lidar. To this end, we attempt to implement two specific objectives, i.e., (1) to derive comprehensive lidar metrics that can serve as versatile predictors for various canopy characteristics, and (2) to investigate the usefulness of machine learning techniques for estimating canopy characteristics from the metrics derived in (1). In particular, for the first objective, we introduced a lidar canopy density composite metric as well as its other equivalent forms (e.g., lidar quantile composite metric) in hopes to take better advantage of information inherent in the raw lidar point data. Each of the composite metrics contains a number of components and thus has a large dimension. For the second objective, we considered two popular machine learning techniques, i.e., support vector machines (SVM) and Gaussian processes (GP). Both techniques are kernel machines that resort to the “kernel” trick for circumventing the curse of dimensionality. To examine the utility of the proposed metrics and kernel learning methods, lidar data acquired over a temperate forest in East Texas, USA, were used in conjunction with coincident field measurements to estimate a range of canopy structural variables.

9. Conclusions
The utility of lidar for characterizing forest ecosystems, e.g., mapping forest biomass, has been unarguably confirmed by a large body of literature, yet the capacity of lidar data for estimating canopy structural characteristics might have not been fully attained with conventional grid-based regression approaches, thus still leaving considerable room for improvement. This study partly fills this room by incorporating some high-dimensional lidar composite metrics into machine learning models. Built upon the canopy height profile metric of Zhao et al. (2009), our proposed composite metrics represent an even more comprehensive set of laser-based predictors, aiming to preserve as much information of raw lidar data as possible. In particular, these metrics indirectly encode the geometrical correspondence between first and last lidar returns, that is, an aspect that has been ignored in previous research. The two kernel machines we employed, i.e. SVM and GPs, are powerful tools to build data-driven nonlinear models for relating canopy variable to lidar metrics. The combined use of the high-dimensional composite metrics and machine learning models partly alleviates the burden of searching for physically, ecologically or statistically meaningful predictors, which expedites testing on the predictive power of lidar for a given canopy structural variable. Results from the case study for the Eastern Texas forest prove that the machine learning models improve upon both the point and interval estimates of a number of canopy structural characteristics as compared to classical regression models. Results also highlight that our composite metrics can serve as universal predictors for estimating many canopy characteristics or even classifying forest types. Further, the use of such advanced machine learning models is expected to increase in future research, e.g., when fusing lidar with other remote sensing data to estimate surface biophysical attributes. In addition, research efforts are still needed regarding the affordable, operational use of lidar for monitoring forest status over time for extensive regions.
