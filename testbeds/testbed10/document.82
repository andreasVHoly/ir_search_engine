Applications of machine learning to ecological modelling 

Friedrich Recknagel

Model validity in terms of generality, realism and accuracy is a permanent challenge to ecological modelling. Generality and realism of inductive ecological models are called into question because of restrictions in their underlying data and techniques (e.g. non-representative number of special cases, multivariate linear statistics) (Livingstone and Imboden, 1996). Generality and realism of deductive ecological models tend to be restricted as well because of their rigid structures and process parameters that do not evolve as in nature (Straskraba, 1979; Radtke and Straskraba, 1980; Kaluzny and Swartzman, 1985; Jorgensen, 1999), and they are limited in complexity.

Machine learning techniques such as artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms basically mimic aspects of biological information processing for data modelling. Their potential for ecology has been demonstrated during the International Conference on Applications of Machine Learning to Ecological Modelling, 27 November to 1 December 2000, Adelaide, Australia. Conference papers indicated that machine learning techniques might consolidate inductive ecological models by dealing with high connectivity, nonlinearity, and complex databases. There is also evidence that they have potential to hybridize deductive ecological models in order to support evolving model structures, process equations, parameters and rules. Newly emerging adaptive agents provide the framework to create ecosystem models that evolve in structure and behaviour.

Basic concepts of machine learning will briefly be introduced before papers presented at this conference and published in the present special issue of Ecological Modelling will be reflected in that context.

1. Machine learning techniques are inductive, data driven modelling approaches. They require reasonable complex databases which need to be representative for the ecological problem domain. 2. ANN techniques prove to be very efficient for non-linear ordination and visualization, multiple regression and time series modelling, as well as image recognition and classification. 3. Sensitivity analysis with trained ANN models can reveal the nature of relationships between driving and output variables in ecosystems. 4. GA techniques can be used to hybridize deductive ecological models. They allow to evolve causal rules and process equations, and to optimize process parameters. 5. Adaptive agents provide a novel framework for the discovery and forecasting of emergent ecosystem structures and behaviours in response to environmental changes.
