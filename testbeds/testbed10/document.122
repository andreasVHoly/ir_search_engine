Machine Learning that Matters

Kiri L. Wagstaf

1. Introduction
At one time or another, we all encounter a friend,
spouse, parent, child, or concerned citizen who, upon
learning that we work in machine learning, wonders
“What’s it good for?” The question may be phrased
more subtly or elegantly, but no matter its form, it gets
at the motivational underpinnings of the work that we
do. Why do we invest years of our professional lives
in machine learning research? What difference does it
make, to ourselves and to the world at large?
Much of machine learning (ML) research is inspired
by weighty problems from biology, medicine, finance,
astronomy, etc. The growing area of computational
sustainability (Gomes, 2009) seeks to connect ML advances
to real-world challenges in the environment,
economy, and society. The CALO (Cognitive Assistant
that Learns and Organizes) project aimed to integrate
learning and reasoning into a desktop assistant, potentially
impacting everyone who uses a computer (SRI
International, 2003–2009). Machine learning has effectively solved spam email detection (Zdziarski, 2005)
and machine translation (Koehn et al., 2003), two
problems of global import. And so on.
And yet we still observe a proliferation of published
ML papers that evaluate new algorithms on a handful
of isolated benchmark data sets. Their “real world”
experiments may operate on data that originated in
the real world, but the results are rarely communicated
back to the origin. Quantitative improvements in performance
are rarely accompanied by an assessment of
whether those gains matter to the world outside of
machine learning research.
This phenomenon occurs because there is no
widespread emphasis, in the training of graduate student
researchers or in the review process for submitted
papers, on connecting ML advances back to the larger
world. Even the rich assortment of applications-driven
ML research often fails to take the final step to translate
results into impact.
Many machine learning problems are phrased in terms
of an objective function to be optimized. It is time for
us to ask a question of larger scope: what is the field’s
objective function? Do we seek to maximize performance
on isolated data sets? Or can we characterize
progress in a more meaningful way that measures the
concrete impact of machine learning innovations?
This short position paper argues for a change in how
we view the relationship between machine learning and
science (and the rest of society). This paper does not
contain any algorithms, theorems, experiments, or results.
Instead it seeks to stimulate creative thought
and research into a large but relatively unaddressed issue
that underlies much of the machine learning field.
The contributions of this work are 1) the clear identifi-
cation and description of a fundamental problem: the
frequent lack of connection between machine learning
research and the larger world of scientific inquiry and
humanity, 2) suggested first steps towards addressing
this gap, 3) the issuance of relevant Impact Challenges
to the machine learning community, and 4) the identification
of several key obstacles to machine learning
impact, as an aid for focusing future research efforts.
Whether or not the reader agrees with all statements
in this paper, if it inspires thought and discussion, then
its purpose has been achieved.

6. Conclusions
Machine learning offers a cornucopia of useful ways to
approach problems that otherwise defy manual solution.
However, much current ML research suffers from
a growing detachment from those real problems. Many
investigators withdraw into their private studies with
a copy of the data set and work in isolation to perfect
algorithmic performance. Publishing results to the ML
community is the end of the process. Successes usually
are not communicated back to the original problem
setting, or not in a form that can be used.
Yet these opportunities for real impact are widespread.
The worlds of law, finance, politics, medicine, education,
and more stand to benefit from systems that
can analyze, adapt, and take (or at least recommend)
action. This paper identifies six examples of Impact
Challenges and several real obstacles in the hope of
inspiring a lively discussion of how ML can best make
a difference. Aiming for real impact does not just
increase our job satisfaction (though it may well do
that); it is the only way to get the rest of the world to
notice, recognize, value, and adopt ML solutions.
