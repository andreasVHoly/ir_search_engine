1. INTRODUCTION
Over the past decade, the Web has grown exponentially in size.
Unfortunately, this growth has not been isolated to good-quality
pages. The number of incorrect, spamming, and malicious (e.g.,
phishing) sites has also grown rapidly. The sheer number of both
good and bad pages on the Web has led to an increasing reliance
on search engines for the discovery of useful information. Users
rely on search engines not only to return pages related to their
search query, but also to separate the good from the bad, and
order results so that the best pages are suggested first.
To date, most work on Web page ranking has focused on
improving the ordering of the results returned to the user (querydependent
ranking, or dynamic ranking). However, having a good
query-independent ranking (static ranking) is also crucially
important for a search engine. A good static ranking algorithm
provides numerous benefits: 

• Relevance: The static rank of a page provides a general
indicator to the overall quality of the page. This is a
useful input to the dynamic ranking algorithm.
• Efficiency: Typically, the search engine’s index is
ordered by static rank. By traversing the index from highquality
to low-quality pages, the dynamic ranker may
abort the search when it determines that no later page
will have as high of a dynamic rank as those already
found. The more accurate the static rank, the better this
early-stopping ability, and hence the quicker the search
engine may respond to queries.
• Crawl Priority: The Web grows and changes as quickly
as search engines can crawl it. Search engines need a way
to prioritize their crawl—to determine which pages to recrawl,
how frequently, and how often to seek out new
pages. Among other factors, the static rank of a page is
used to determine this prioritization. A better static rank
thus provides the engine with a higher quality, more upto-date
index. 

7. CONCLUSIONS
A good static ranking is an important component for today’s
search engines and information retrieval systems. We have
demonstrated that PageRank does not provide a very good static
ranking; there are many simple features that individually out
perform PageRank. By combining many static features, fRank
achieves a ranking that has a significantly higher pairwise
accuracy than PageRank alone. A qualitative evaluation of the top
documents shows that fRank is less technology-biased than
PageRank; by using popularity data, it is biased toward pages that
Web users, rather than Web authors, visit. The machine learning
component of fRank gives it the additional benefit of being more
robust against spammers, and allows it to leverage further
developments in the machine learning community in areas such as
adversarial classification. We have only begun to explore the
options, and believe that significant strides can be made in the
area of static ranking by further experimentation with additional
features, other machine learning techniques, and additional
sources of data.
