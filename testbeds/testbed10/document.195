Evaluation and Selection of Biases in Machine
Learning

DIANA F. GORDON 

1. Introduction
This special issue of Machine Learning focuses on the evaluation and selection of biases.
The papers in this issue describe methods by which intelligent systems automatically evaluate
and select their own biases, and tools for analyzing and testing various approaches to
bias selection. In this paper, we motivate the importance of this topic. Since most readers
will be familiar with supervised concept learning, we phrase our discussion within that
framework. However, bias as we present it here is a part of every type of learning.
We outline a framework for treating bias selection as a process of designing appropriate
search methods over the bias and meta-bias spaces. This framework has two essential
features: it divides bias into representational and procedural components, and it characterizes
learning as search within multiple tiers. The sources of bias within a system
can thus be identified and analyzed with respect to their influence on this multi-tiered
search process, and bias shift becomes search at the bias level. The framework provides
an analytic tool with which to compare different systems (including those not developed
within the framework), as well as an abstract formalism and architecture to guide the
development of new systems.
We begin by defining what we mean by the term bias. Next, we explain why the selection
and evaluation of biases is a critical task for intelligent systems. We then describe
our search-based framework for bias selection. Finally, we survey recent research in this
field, using the concepts developed in our framework to guide the discussion.


7. Conclusions
The framework we have presented for treating bias selection as search has two essential
features: bias is divided into representational and procedural components, and learning
systems are characterized as potentially having multiple tiers of search (in hypothesis

space, bias space, meta-bias space, and so on). We advocate the use of this framework
both as a tool for understanding, analyzing, and comparing existing systems, and as a
basis for guiding the design and development of new machine learning systems. We
believe that doing analysis and development within this framework will lead to a better
understanding of where the implicit and explicit biases in learning systems lie, will
reduce both system development and knowledge engineering time and effort, and will
allow explicit representation and incorporation of considerations such as background
knowledge and cost.
Of course, the framework provides only the skeleton of a design and an abstract
formalism for representing and analyzing bias as a multiple-tiered search process. The
real work will come in the development of systems that fill in the components of the
outline we have sketched, and that are able to perform learning in complex and dynamic
domains. The papers in this issue begin to address some of the critical questions in this
development; we hope that this special issue of Machine Learning inspires the research
community to look more closely at the central issue of the evaluation and selection of
biases in machine learning systems.
