WEKA: A Machine Learning Workbench

Geoffrey Holmes, Andrew Donkin, and Ian H. Witten 

1. Introduction
Machine learning is a burgeoning new
technology with a wide range of applications.
It has the potential to become one of the key
components of intelligent information
systems, enabling compact generalizations,
inferred from large databases of recorded
information, to be applied as knowledge in
various practical ways-such as being
embedded in automatic processes like expert
systems, or used directly for communicating
with human experts and for educational
purposes. Presently, however, the field is
not well placed to do this. Most research
effort is directed towards the invention of
new algorithms for learning, rather than
towards gaining experience in applying
existing techniques to real problems. The
WEKA* project (Waikato Environment for
Knowledge Analysis) is redressing the
balance by applying standard machine
learning techniques to a variety of agricultural
and horticultural problems. Our goal is to
discover and characterize what is required for successful applications of machine learning
to real-world data.
To support this effort, a workbench has
been developed to provide an integrated
environment which not only gives easy
access to a variety of machine learning
techniques through an interactive interface,
but also incorporates those pre- and postprocessing
tools that we have found to be
essential when working with real-world data
sets.
Other systems for machine learning
experimentation exist [ 1,2,3], but these are
libraries of routines that are intended for use
by a researcher who is extending and
comparing algorithms. One exceptionalthough
still a library of modules-is
Consultant [4], an expert system that allows
domain experts to choose a learning
algorithm suited to their needs. Consultant
assumes that a machine learning algorithm
exists that can be applied directly to solve the
problem at hand. Our experience has been
that although a suitable algorithm may well
exist, it is unlikely that its direct application
on the domain expertâ€™s data will produce a
meaningful result. Domain experts, in our
experience, need an environment in which
they can easily manipulate data and run
experiments themselves.
The philosophy behind WEKA is to move
away from supporting a computer science or
machine learning researcher, and towards
supporting the end user of machine learning.
The end user is someone-typically, in our
applications, an agricultural scientist-with
an understanding of the data and sufficient
knowledge of the capabilities of machine
learning to select and investigate the
application of different techniques. In order
to maintain this philosophy, we have
concentrated on ensuring that the
implementation details of the machine
learning algorithms and the input formats
they require are hidden from the user.
This paper describes the workbench and
some of the experiences we have had in applying it to real-world data. We describe
some of the support tools for viewing,
analysing and manipulating data, and discuss
our plans for future development of the
workbench. 4. Conclusions and future work
Our experience of processing real-world
data sets has enabled us to identify a number
of issues that influence future development of
WEKA. Most agricultural and horticultural
data is characterised by one or more timedependent
attributes that are largely ignored
or misused by the schemes in the workbench
[14]. This has led us to consider the role of
sequence-identification schemes such as
hidden Markov models in machine learning.
We plan to develop hybrid schemes for
WEKA which identify time-dependent data
directly, and interpret it correctly.
As mentioned earlier, most data originates
from a database which is typically
constructed from many relations. Performing
many join operations on the data, which is
generally necessary to convert it into the flat
file format expected by most machine
learning techniques, inevitably introduces
greater duplication and functional
dependencies [ 141. We are enabling the
machine learning schemes to be applied
directly to the data in the database in much
the same way as systems that perform
knowledge discovery in databases [17]. This
approach allows owners of the data to use
WEKA immediately, rather than waiting for a
macro, Per1 script or database query to be
written.
Finally, as a further encouragement to
knowledgeable users, we are investigating
the feasibility of adding an interactive scheme
such as PROTOS [I81 to the workbench. This will allow users to build applications
using both their specialist knowledge of the
data and the learning capability of the
match of skills needed to build successful
intelligent information systems using
machine learning.
