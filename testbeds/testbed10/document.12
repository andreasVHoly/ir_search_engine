Coreference resolution is the process of determining whether two expressions in natural language refer to the same entity in the world. It is an important subtask in natural language processing systems. In particular, information extraction (IE) systems like those built in the DARPA Message Understanding Conferences (Chinchor 1998; Sundheim 1995) have revealed that coreference resolution is such a critical component of IE systems that a separate coreference subtask has been defined and evaluated since MUC-6 (MUC-6 1995). In this paper, we focus on the task of determining coreference relations as defined in MUC-6 (MUC-6 1995) and MUC-7 (MUC-7 1997). Specifically, a coreference relation denotes an identity of reference and holds between two textual elements known as markables, which can be definite noun phrases, demonstrative noun phrases, proper names, appositives, sub–noun phrases that act as modifiers, pronouns, and so on. Thus, our coreference task resolves general noun phrases and is not restricted to a certain type of noun phrase such as pronouns. Also, we do not place any restriction on the possible candidate markables; that is, all markables, whether they are “organization,” “person,” or other entity types, are considered. The ability to link coreferring noun phrases both within and across sentences is critical to discourse analysis and language understanding in general.
