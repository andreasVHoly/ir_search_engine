Applications of Machine Learning in Cancer Prediction
and Prognosis

Joseph A. Cruz, David S. Wishart

Introduction
Machine learning is not new to cancer research. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) and decision trees
(DTs) have been used in cancer detection and diagnosis for nearly 20 years (Simes 1985; Maclin et al.
1991; Ciccheti 1992). Today machine learning methods are being used in a wide range of applications
ranging from detecting and classifying tumors via X-ray and CRT images (Petricoin and Liotta 2004;
Bocchi et al. 2004) to the classification of malignancies from proteomic and genomic (microarray)
assays (Zhou et al. 2004; Dettling 2004; Wang et al. 2005). According to the latest PubMed statistics,
more than 1500 papers have been published on the subject of machine learning and cancer. However,
the vast majority of these papers are concerned with using machine learning methods to identify, classify,
detect, or distinguish tumors and other malignancies. In other words machine learning has been used
primarily as an aid to cancer diagnosis and detection (McCarthy et al. 2004). It has only been relatively
recently that cancer researchers have attempted to apply machine learning towards cancer prediction
and prognosis. As a consequence the body of literature in the field of machine learning and cancer
prediction/prognosis is relatively small (<120 papers).
The fundamental goals of cancer prediction and prognosis are distinct from the goals of cancer detection
and diagnosis. In cancer prediction/prognosis one is concerned with three predictive foci: 1) the prediction of
cancer susceptibility (i.e. risk assessment); 2) the prediction of cancer recurrence and 3) the prediction of
cancer survivability. In the first case, one is trying to predict the likelihood of developing a type of cancer prior
to the occurrence of the disease. In the second case one is trying to predict the likelihood of redeveloping
cancer after to the apparent resolution of the disease. In the third case one is trying to predict an outcome (life
expectancy, survivability, progression, tumor-drug sensitivity) after the diagnosis of the disease. In the latter
two situations the success of the prognostic prediction is obviously dependent, in part, on the success or quality
of the diagnosis. However a disease prognosis can only come after a medical diagnosis and a prognostic
prediction must take into account more than just a simple diagnosis (Hagerty et al. 2005).
