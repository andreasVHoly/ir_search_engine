Clinical prediction rules can be developed using a number of techniques, including a variety of statistical methods (e.g., logistic and linear regression, discriminant analysis, and recursive partitioning [CART]), and the clinical judgment of experts [ 1,2]. For predicting dichotomous outcomes, logistic regression has emerged as the statistical technique of choice [3]. Artificial neural networks represent a newer technique that has emerged as a potential alternative to logistic regression analysis and other classical statistlcal techniques [4,5]. Neural networks are not constrained by a predefined mathematical relationship hetween dependent and independent variables, and have the ability to model any arbitrarily complex nonlinear relacionship [6]. Developers of artiftcial neural network prediction models du not require formal training m statistical methodology, and models can be developed hy users with a minimum of theoretical knowledge. A few studies suggest that they may offer significantly better predictive performance than traditional statistical methods for certain prohlems [7,8]. Thus, neural networks may represent an attractive alternative to logistic regression as a statistical modeling technique under certain circumstances. Logistic Regression Logistic regression is a widely used statistical modeling technique in which the prohahility of an outcome 1s related to a series of potential predictor variables hy an equation of the form log [p/C 1 - p)] = pa + p,x, + /?ZLx? + + p,x, (1) where I, is the probability of the outcome of interest, /$ is an intercept term, pi, . ., p, are the p coefficients associated with each variable, X,, ., X, are the values of the potential predictor variahles, and i is a unique subscript denoting each variable [3]. The usual assumption is that these predictor variables are related in a linear manner to the log odds { log[e/( 1 - e)]> of the outcome of interest. Variables are usually selected for inclusion in these models through some form of backward or forward stepwise regression technique, although stepwise variable selection techniques may he prone to problems [9]. Full model fits without deletion of insignificant variables may be preferred under certain circumstances [lo]. Logistic regression models use as their convergence criterion the maximization of a likelihood function. p coefficients can easily he converted into the corresponding odds ratios by raising e to the coefficient if variables are represented hy a single linear term or as dummy variables, and one can easily interpret the magnitude of importance of a predictor. In addition, widely accepted criteria such as the HosmerLemeshow statistic have been developed for assessing the “goodness of fit” of these models [3]. Thus, logistic regression has become the technique of choice for statistical modeling in which the outcome of interest is dichotomous (e.g., mortality).
