1. Introduction It is well established that ageing influences gait patterns and considerable research has documented changes during unobstructed and obstructed walking that suggest age-related declines in lower limbcontrol (Princea et al., 1997; Begg and Sparrow, 2000). The major aim has been to identify key variables of gait degeneration in elderly individuals that might be predictors of falling behaviour. Research has shown that significant changes in gait can occur with age in temporal and distance measures such as gait velocity, stride length, and stance and swing phase times (Hageman and Blanke, 1986; Winter, 1991). In addition, footground reaction force data during braking and propulsive phases (Winter, 1991; Nigg et al., 1994; Begg et al.,1998) and joint angular motion data such as the ankle, knee and hip joint angles (Judge et al., 1996; Kerrigan et al., 1998) have shown effects of aging. To date, however, the relative influence of these measures in differentiating the age groups has not been demonstrated. Automated recognition of gait pattern changes by a machine classifier from their respective measures is expected to offer many potential advantages. For example, Maki (1997) using spatial-temporal measures of gait has shown significant changes in gait characteristics in the elderly fallers when compared to gait characteristics of elderly non-fallers. This research has particularly shown that some foot placement gait measures (e.g., step width and stride variability) displayed greater associations with falls prediction. Therefore, early identification of gait changes due to falling behaviour by a machine classifier might trigger initiation of necessary measures to prevent injurious falls such as an exercise intervention program (Lordet al., 2003). Similar benefits could also be obtained in a clinical context via identification of abnormality in gait patterns and also by evaluating the effectiveness of treatment outcomes. In order to facilitate automated recognition of gait patterns, neural networks and fuzzy clustering techniques have been applied for classification of normal and pathological gait (Holzreiter and Kohle, 1993; Oâ€™Malley et al., 1997), and also to differentiate gait simulations, such as leg length discrepancy from joint-angle measures (Barton and Lees, 1997). However, it is well known that there are several limitations of neural network-based modelling, including: (i) dependency on a large number of parameters, e.g., network size, learning parameters and selection of initial weights, (ii) the possibility of being trapped into local minima, and (iii) over-fitting on training data resulting in poor generalization. Recently, support vector machines (SVM) have emerged as a powerful technique for general purpose pattern recognition. It has been applied to classification and regression problems with exceptionally good performance on a range of binary classification tasks (Zavaljevski et al., 2002; Ben-Yacoub et al., 1999; Chapelle et al., 1999; Ding and Dubchak, 2001; Chan et al., 2002). The primary advantage of SVM is its ability to minimize both structural and empirical risk (Gunn, 1998) leading to better generalization for new data classification. Despite the success of SVM in other biomedical applications there has been little research on the classification ability of SVM in gait. Lee and Grimson (2002) showed that SVM achieved 94% accuracy in gender classification using gait video sequence data but there have been no reports known to the authors of SVMs applied to detect gait changes due to ageing. In the study reported here, we applied an SVM for automated recognition of young/old gait patterns using temporal and distance measures, kinetic and kinematic variables in the development of gait models to investigate their relative influence on classification.
