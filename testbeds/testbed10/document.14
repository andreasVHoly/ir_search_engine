Data mining and knowledge discovery in database is an intelligent method of discovering unknown or unexplored relationship within a large database. It uses the principles of pattern recognition and machine learning to discover the knowledge, and various statistical and visualisation techniques to present knowledge in a comprehensible form. The theory of rough sets (Pawlak, 1991) offers a theoretical basis for reasoning about data and is found to be an effective tool for the decision support system. This theory gives a set-theoretic definition of knowledge, based on equivalence relation and provides algorithms for reduction of number of attributes, rule generation and classifi- cation related to any information system. Rough set theoretic classifiers perform better with the discrete valued (symbolic) attributes or features. These can be applied to continuous valued attributes using a process called (crisp) discretization (Lenarcik and Piasta, 1992; Nguyen and Skowron, 1995; Nguyen and Nguyen, 1998). The crisp discretization is a method of generating a set of values or the ‘cuts’ of attributes within the dynamic ranges of the corresponding attributes. The intervals formed by the adjacent values of the cuts, become the discrete groups for the continuous valued attributes. The positions of cuts are very sensitive to the subsets of the information system, which are used to generate the cuts, as well as to the methodology adopted. The position sensitivity of cuts may make the classification accuracy adversely affected. In order to avoid this problem thepresent article introduces the concept of fuzzy discretization, which uses the cuts obtained from crisp discretization and transforms a decision table of continuous valued attributes to a fuzzy discretized decision table. This incorporates the positional information of the samples within an interval. The superiority of the proposed scheme in terms of both producer accuracy (PA) and user accuracy (UA) is established on speech and hepatobiliary disorder data. For this purpose we have used both rough set theoretic classifier and multilayer perceptrons (MLP) which are capable of handling symbolic input.
