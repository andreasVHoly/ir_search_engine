Machine Learning Techniques in Spam Filtering

Konstantin Tretyakov

It is impossible to tell exactly who was the first one to come upon a simple
idea that if you send out an advertisement to millions of people, then at least one
person will react to it no matter what is the proposal. E-mail provides a perfect
way to send these millions of advertisements at no cost for the sender, and this
unfortunate fact is nowadays extensively exploited by several organizations. As
a result, the e-mailboxes of millions of people get cluttered with all this so-called
unsolicited bulk e-mail also known as “spam” or “junk mail”. Being increadibly
cheap to send, spam causes a lot of trouble to the Internet community: large
amounts of spam-traffic between servers cause delays in delivery of legitimate email,
people with dial-up Internet access have to spend bandwidth downloading
junk mail. Sorting out the unwanted messages takes time and introduces a
risk of deleting normal mail by mistake. Finally, there is quite an amount of
pornographic spam that should not be exposed to children.
Many ways of fighting spam have been proposed. There are “social” methods
like legal measures (one example is an anti-spam law introduced in the US
[21]) and plain personal involvement (never respond to spam, never publish
your e-mail address on webpages, never forward chain-letters. . . [22]). There are “technological” ways like blocking spammer’s IP-address, and, at last, there is
e-mail filtering. Unfortunately, no universal and perfect way for eliminating
spam exists yet, so the amount of junk mail keeps increasing. For example,
about 50% of the messages coming to my personal mailbox is spam.

5 The Conclusion
Before I started writing this paper I had a strong opinion, that a good machinelearning
spam filtering algorithm is not possible, and the only reliable way of
filtering spam is by creating a set of rules by hand. I have changed my mind a
bit by now. That is the main result for me. I hope that the reader too could
find something new for him in this work.
