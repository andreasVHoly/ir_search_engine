1. INTRODUCTION
Brain-Computer Interfacing is an interesting, active and highly
interdisciplinary research topic ([3, 4, 5, 6]) at the interface
between medicine, psychology, neurology, rehabilitation
engineering, man-machine interaction, machine learning
and signal processing. A BCI could, e.g., allow a paralyzed
patient to convey her/his intentions to a computer
application. From the perspective of man-machine interaction
research, the communication channel from a healthy
human’s brain to a computer has not yet been subject to intensive
exploration, however it has potential, e.g., to speed
up reaction times, cf. [7] or to supply a better understanding
of a human operator’s mental states.
Classical BCI technology has been mainly relying on
the adaptability of the human brain to biofeedback, i.e., a
subject learns the mental states required to be understood
by the machines, an endeavour that can take months until it
reliably works [8, 9].
The Berlin Brain-Computer Interface (BBCI) pursues
another objective in this respect, i.e., to impose the main
load of the learning task on the ’learning machine’, which
also holds the potential of adapting to specific tasks and
changing environments given that suitable machine learning
(e.g. [2]) and adaptive signal processing (e.g. [10]) algorithms
are used. Short training times, however, imply
the challenge that only few data samples are available for learning to characterize the individual brain states to be distinguished.
In particular when dealing with few samples
of data (trials of the training session) in a high-dimensional
feature space (multi-channel EEG, typically several features
per channel), overfitting needs to be avoided. It is in this
high dimensional – small sample statistics scenario where
modern machine learning can prove its strength.
The present review introduces basic concepts of machine
learning, which includes a discussion of common linear
classification and the idea of classifying in kernel feature
spaces. Classification is linked to the interesting task
of robust feature selection. Finally, we briefly describe our
BBCI activities where some of the discussed machine learning
ideas come to an application and conclude. Note that
we do not attempt a full treatment of all available literature,
rather, we present a somewhat biased point of view illustrating
the main ideas by drawing mainly from the work of
the authors and providing – to the best of our knowledge –
reference to related work for further reading. We hope that
it nevertheless will be useful for the reader.

7. CONCLUSION
After a brief review of general linear and non-linear machine
learning techniques, this paper discussed variable selection
methods and their application to EEG data. These
techniques are a salient ingredient of the BBCI online feedback
system. Note that although machine learning algorithms
were initially always tested offline, it is the mastery
of choosing the ’right’ complexity for a learning problem
that makes the resulting classifiers generalize and thus renders
them useful in real BCI feedback experiments. In particular
the paradigm shift away from subject training to individualization
and adaptation (’let the machines that learn’)
of the signal processing and classification algorithm to the
specific brain ’under study’ holds the key to the success of
the BBCI. Being able to use (B)BCI for untrained subjects
dramatically enhances and broadens the spectrum of practical
applications in human-computer interfacing.
