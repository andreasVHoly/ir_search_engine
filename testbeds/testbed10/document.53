In the last few years there has been growing interest in the use of machine learning classifiers for analyzing fMRI data. A growing number of studies has shown that machine learning classifiers can be used to extract exciting new information from neuroimaging data (see Norman et al., 2006 and Haynes and Rees, 2006 for selective reviews). Along with the growth in interest and breadth of application, the methods underlying the use of classifiers with fMRI have continuously evolved and ramified (see OToole et al., 2007 for a historical overview). Given the novelty of the approach, there have been few attempts to organize and interrelate available methods in a single place. The present article strives to rectify that situation by providing a tutorial introduction to classifier methods in fMRI. Given that space constraints prevent us from being exhaustive, our focus is on introducing the methodology and the most common choices in its various aspects and, through that, perspective and references for further study. Our presentation will be organized around the idea that classifierbased analyses, like traditional fMRI analyses, can be characterized in terms of a series of specific choices over a series of decision points in the analysis process, starting from selection of the scientific question to be asked and ending with choices among tests for hypotheses. We begin by laying out an illustrative example of a classifier-based analysis, and then dissect the analysis process, examining the set of choices it implicitly involves, and the alternatives available at each stage. There have been other proposals for a staged procedure forusing classifiers to analyze fMRI data (e.g. Strother et al., 2002), though with an emphasis on a single type of classifier and requiring the use of dimensionality reduction. We broaden this idea to include several kinds of classifier and also the use of feature selection. We conclude with a discussion of the sorts of scientific questions that may be fruitfully addressed using classifiers, and the ways in which the choice of question impacts subsequent analysis decisions. Where possible, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of competing options. However, it is important to acknowledge from the outset that firm grounds for such evaluations are in many cases not yet available. Inasmuch as we can, we offer recommendations based on the results of formal principles or controlled empirical tests (from Pereira, 2007). Where these are lacking, we shall sometimes inject impressions drawn from our own personal experience with classifierbased analysis of fMRI data. Before entering into the discussion of the analysis proper, we begin in the next section by briefly introducing machine learning classifiers in their own right. In this paper we have described the various stages in a machine learning classifier analysis of fMRI data. Aside from discussing the choices available at each analysis stage, their interactions and the practical factors conditioning them, we explored the use of this kind of analysis to answer three types of scientific question. These are ‘is there information about a variable of interest’ (pattern discrimination), ‘where is the information’ (pattern localization) and ‘how is that information encoded’ (pattern characterization). We purposefully focused on linear classifiers and the discrimination and localization questions, as these are both better understood and the ones most readers are likely to want to answer first. Space constraints meant that some important practical considerations had to be left out of the main text. Various appendices are provided in a longer version of this paper available at http://www.princeton.edu/~matthewb or http://www.cs. cmu.edu/~fpereira. MATLAB software for performing a classifier analysis (the Princeton Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis toolbox) can be found at http://www.csbmb.princeton.edu/mvpa, together with tutorials and a very responsive online community. Alternatively, there is a separately developed Python version of the toolbox (PyMVPA) available at http:// www.pymvpa.org/. What we have tried to do in the present article is to lay out a roadmap, identifying the key decision points involved in classifierbased imaging analyses, and tracing out the available routes among them. Like any map, this one will require continual updating, as the terrain itself evolves. If the past is any model, then frequent and often dramatic changes in classifier-based techniques can be expected over coming years, especially in nascent areas such as pattern characterization. Regardless of the changes to come, however, it is clear that classifier-based approaches have already evolved to the point where it is possible to begin establishing a principled consensus concerning basic aspects of methodology, similar to the one that has coalesced around longer-established univariate analysis techniques.
