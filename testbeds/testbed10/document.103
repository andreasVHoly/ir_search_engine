Climate warming has led to changes in the composition, density and distribution of Arctic vegetation in recent decades1, 2, 3, 4. These changes cause multiple opposing feedbacks between the biosphere and atmosphere5, 6, 7, 8, 9, the relative magnitudes of which will have globally significant consequences but are unknown at a pan-Arctic scale10. The precise nature of Arctic vegetation change under future warming will strongly influence climate feedbacks, yet Earth system modelling studies have so far assumed arbitrary increases in shrubs (for example, +20%; refs 6, 11), highlighting the need for predictions of future vegetation distribution shifts. Here we show, using climate scenarios for the 2050s and models that utilize statistical associations between vegetation and climate, the potential for extremely widespread redistribution of vegetation across the Arctic. We predict that at least half of vegetated areas will shift to a different physiognomic class, and woody cover will increase by as much as 52%. By incorporating observed relationships between vegetation and albedo, evapotranspiration and biomass, we show that vegetation distribution shifts will result in an overall positive feedback to climate that is likely to cause greater warming than has previously been predicted. Such extensive changes to Arctic vegetation will have implications for climate, wildlife and ecosystem services.

Whereas our approach for predicting future vegetation distribution relies on statistical associations rather than biological mechanisms, process-based Earth system climate models with dynamic vegetation have also been developed and applied in the Arctic and boreal regions2. Process-based models generally operate at very coarse spatial resolutions (for example, half-degree)15, focus on a subregion16, or do not provide spatially explicit predictions of shifts in vegetation types17. Process-based models also may not adequately incorporate all processes or plant functional types that influence vegetation-climate feedbacks in the Arctic18. In particular, Arctic vegetation is commonly resolved into too few categories to include some plant types that are thought to have important physical and biogeochemical implications for the climate system, including mosses, lichens and deciduous shrubs19. As process-based representations of vegetation dynamics continue to improve, statistical ecological niche models provide a valuable parallel approach.

We find that vegetation in 48–69% of our study area is predicted to shift to a different physiognomic class under scenarios of restricted tree dispersal and climate change for the 2050s (Supplementary Methods). As much as 57–84% of the area is predicted to shift to a different class under an equilibrium scenario with unrestricted dispersal, which is supported by evidence of rapid shifts to larger growth forms due to phenotypic variation4 and rapid colonization due to long-distance dispersal20, expansion from isolated refugia21, and favourable conditions for establishment following large tundra fires22 and thermokarst related to permafrost thaw23. Such widespread redistribution of Arctic vegetation (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S2) would have impacts that reverberate through higher trophic levels24, affecting wildlife and ecosystem services that are important for human well-being, including food production, access to natural resources, and traditional cultural identity25. These impacts would extend far beyond the Arctic region owing to effects on species that seasonally migrate from lower latitudes and rely on finding particular polar habitats, such as open space for ground-nesting birds26.

The equilibrium scenario shown in Fig. 1 illustrates the potential for massive expansion of tree cover, including across much of northern Siberia, as climate becomes suitable for tree growth sometimes hundreds of kilometres north of the present tree line. In many areas, including on Alaska’s North Slope, erect dwarf-shrub tundra (class S1) and low-shrub tundra (class S2) are predicted to encroach into landscapes dominated by graminoids at present. In other areas, prostrate shrubs are predicted to be replaced by erect shrubs; for instance, in the southern half of Baffin Island prostrate dwarf-shrub, herb tundra (class P1) is predicted to become erect dwarf-shrub tundra (class S1; Fig. 1). Although these trends are largely consistent across alternative models and scenarios, the choice of atmosphere–ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) and machine-learning algorithm does affect the results (Supplementary Fig. S2) and fine-scale results for a particular scenario should not be interpreted as precise predictions. Moreover, there are other positive feedbacks associated with shrub expansion that we have not accounted for, including local soil warming and increases in nutrient availability27. These factors will lead to an underestimation of woody vegetation expansion, offsetting factors that could affect predictions in the opposite direction, such as time lags associated with growth and recruitment. However, although the model results are likely to differ from realized outcomes in detail, the models provide useful estimates of broad-scale trends and the likely magnitude of change over the coming century.

Considering changes in the area covered by each class, summarized across all alternative models and scenarios (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S3), we predict large contractions for some vegetation classes. Risk of extinction will be increased for species found within classes that contract. In general, distributions of lower-lying vegetation classes with sparse plant cover are predicted to contract as larger shrubs and trees expand their ranges; however, the spatial configuration of high-latitude land masses complicates this general trend. For instance, tundra vegetation dominated by tussock sedge, dwarf shrub and moss (class G4) is predicted to contract despite having the tallest plants and densest coverage of the four graminoid classes considered (Fig. 2). This class is mostly restricted to Alaska, Siberia and north-eastern Russia, which are regions that do not have more northerly land masses to which vegetation could shift as trees and larger shrubs immigrate from the south.

We used composites of MODIS data for the years 2001–2010 to calculate changes in albedo and evapotranspiration. Incident short-wave radiation used to calculate SN was generated for the years 2001–2003. Biomass was mapped by the CAVM team30 by calculating the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from AVHRR data and then transforming NDVI to AGB on the basis of calibration with in situ harvest data. Biomass was converted to atmospheric CO2 equivalent to calculate the associated radiative forcing
