Introduction
Most opinion mining algorithms attempt to identify the polarity of sentiment in text: positive, negative, or neutral. Although for many applications this is sufficient, texts often contain a mix of positive and negative sentiment and for some applications it is necessary to detect both simultaneously and also to detect the strength of sentiment expressed. For instance, programs to monitor sentiment in online communication, perhaps designed to identify and intervene when inappropriate emotions are used or to identify at risk users (e.g., Huang, Goh, & Liew, 2007), would need to be sensitive to the strength of sentiment expressed and whether participants were appropriately balancing positive and negative sentiment. In addition, basic research to understand the role of emotion in online communication (e.g., Derks, Fischer, & Bos, 2008; e.g., Hancock, Gee, Ciaccio, & Lin, 2008; Nardi, 2005) would also benefit from fine-grained sentiment detection, as would the growing body of psychology and other social science research into the role of sentiment in various types of discussion or general discourse (Balahur, Kozareva, & Montoyo, 2009; Pennebaker, Mehl, & Niederhoffer, 2003; Short & Palmer, 2008).

A complicating factor for online sentiment detection is that there are many electronic communications media in which text-based communication in English seems to frequently ignore the rules of grammar and spelling. Perhaps most famous is mobile phone text language with its abbreviations, emoticons, and truncated sentences (Grinter & Eldridge, 2003; Thurlow, 2003), but similar styles are evident in many other forms of computer-mediated communication, including chatrooms, bulletin boards, and social network sites (Baron, 2003; Crystal, 2006). Widely recognized innovations include emoticons like:-) that are reasonably effective in conveying emotion (Derks, Bos, & von Grumbkow, 2008; Fullwood & Martino, 2007) and word abbreviations like m8 (mate) and u (you) (Thurlow, 2003). Although sometimes seen as poor language use, these are a natural response to the technological affordances and social factors associated with a system (Baron, 2003; Walther & Parks, 2002). These variations cause problems because typical linguistic sentiment analysis programs start with part of speech tagging (e.g., Brill, 1992), which is reliant upon standard spelling and grammar, and/or apply rules that assume at least correct spelling, if not correct grammar. Spelling correction can be useful in this context, but this is based upon the assumption that spelling deviations are likely to be accidental mistakes (Kukich, 1992; Pollock & Zamora, 1984) and so current algorithms are unlikely to work well with deliberately nonstandard spellings. Nevertheless, there is a range of common abbreviations and new words that a linguistic algorithm could, in principle, detect. Nonlinguistic machine learning algorithms typically predict sentiment based upon occurrences of individual words, word pairs, and word triples in documents. These may also perform poorly on informal text because of spelling problems and creativity in sentiment expression, even if a large training corpus is available (see below).

The social network site MySpace, the source of the data used in the current study, is known for its young members, its musical orientation, and its informal communication patterns (boyd, 2008a, 2008b). Probably as a result of these factors 95% of English public comments exchanged between friends contain at least one abbreviation from standard English (Thelwall, 2009). Common features include emoticons, texting-style abbreviations, and the use of repeated letters or punctuation for emphasis (e.g., a loooong time, Hi!!!). Comments are typically short (mean 18.7 words, median 13 words, 68 characters; Thelwall, 2009), but positive emotion is common (Thelwall, Wilkinson, & Uppal, 2010).

This article proposes a new algorithm, SentiStrength, which employs several novel methods to simultaneously extract positive and negative sentiment strength from short informal electronic text. SentiStrength uses a dictionary of sentiment words with associated strength measures and exploits a range of recognized nonstandard spellings and other common textual methods of expressing sentiment. SentiStrength was developed through an initial set of 2,600 human-classified MySpace comments, and evaluated on a further random sample of 1,041 MySpace comments. Note that in some articles, but not in emotion psychology, the term sentiment refers to affect split into positive, negative, and neutral whereas the term emotion refers to more differentiated affect (e.g., happy, sad, frightened). In contrast, the two terms are used as synonyms here, with their meaning effectively defined by the coder instructions described below. The main novel contributions of this article are a machine-learning approach to optimize sentiment term weightings, methods for extracting sentiment from repeated-letter nonstandard spelling in informal text, and a related spelling correction method. In addition, we introduce a dual 5-point system for positive and negative sentiment, a corpus of 1,041 MySpace comments for this system, and a new overall sentiment strength detection system that combines novel and existing methods.


Discussion and Conclusions
Recall that the main novel contributions of this are a machine-learning approach to optimize sentiment term weightings; methods for extracting sentiment from nonstandard spelling in text; and a related spelling correction method. SentiStrength was able to identify the strength of positive sentiment on a scale of 1 to 5 in 60.6% of the time in informal MySpace language, significantly above the best standard machine-learning approaches, which had a performance of up to 58.5%—in line with those for a previous four-category opinion intensity classification task (Wilson et al., 2006). The standard version of SentiStrength was also better than standard machine-learning methods when their performance was improved (or not, in some cases) with the use of subsumption and information gain feature reduction, but the difference was not statistically significant. A slightly modified version of SentiStrength was statistically significantly better than the improved machine learning methods, however. This is good evidence of the efficacy of SentiStrength for positive sentiment strength detection given the range of different algorithms and parameters that it was compared against (9 algorithms ×11 feature set sizes, ×7 feature set types=693 variations, plus 9 algorithms ×10 feature set sizes ×3 α values=270 variations for subsumption), which gives lower-performing algorithms a reasonable statistical chance of outperforming SentiStrength through chance, but none did.

The main reason for SentiStrength's relative success seems to be procedures for decoding nonstandard spellings and methods for boosting the strength of words, which accounted for much of its performance. Without these factors, the SentiStrength variant based solely upon a dictionary of emotion-associated words and their estimated strengths with 57.5% was only 1.3% better than the most successful machine-learning approach on an extended set of 1-3 grams. In contrast, SentiStrength was able to identify negative sentiment little better (1.8%) than the baseline, probably due to creativity in expressing negative comments or due to the difficulty in getting significantly above the baseline when one category dominates (Artstein & Poesio, 2008; Krippendorff, 2004). It seems that both positive and negative sentiment detection in informal text language like MySpace comments is challenging because of several factors: language creativity, expressions of sentiment without emotion-bearing words, and differences between human coder interpretations—meaning that there is not a genuinely correct classification for most comments.

Given the success in generating an algorithm for positive sentiment strength detection and the predominance of positive sentiment in MySpace comments, it seems that future research can apply the sentiment strength detection techniques to automatically identify and classify positive sentiment in informal web communication environments on a large scale. Moreover, there are many commercial applications of sentiment analysis, some of which use informal computer text generate from chatrooms or mobile phone text messages, and this algorithm shows that it is possible to estimate the strength of positive sentiment even in these short messages.

In terms of future work, a next logical step is to attempt to improve the performance of the system through linguistic processing, despite the poor grammar of the short informal text messages analyzed. Previous work has shown that this approach is promising, particularly via dependency trees (Wilson et al., 2009) and that, given a large enough training sample, improvements may be possible even in poor-quality text (Gamon, 2004).
