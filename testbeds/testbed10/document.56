Law, learning and representation

1. Law as a learning system As everyone knows, a large part of what we call law is comprised of rules and cases. Law, especially in Common Law countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom, is based on a combination of statutes, constitutions, and cases; in Civil Law countries, such as France, it is based more directly on rules and codes. However, it is universal that legal rules play a large part of any legal system. The legal rules come from a variety of sources: legislatures may fashion them in statutes, agencies may adopt them as regulations, courts may promulgate them as rules for deciding current cases and summarizing the meaning of past cases, and practitioners use them to distill past experience. Legal rules are dynamic; they change in response to social and political influences. As society develops economically, technologically and culturally, new disputes arise. Lower courts decide the new cases in light of existing legal rules with results that may not square with changing political, social and cultural realities. Legislatures, agencies or higher courts may respond by changing the legal rules or applying them differently, conforming the results of new cases to the new realities. Two ways in which one can change the effect of a rule are by (1) changing the rule itself, for instance, by adding conjuncts to pre-conditions or listing exceptions to the rule, or (2) changing the meaning of the rule’s constituent concepts. We will refer to the first type of change as change in the rule’s structure and the second type as a change in the meaning of its terms. Where legal rules define legal concepts—the rule’s prerequisites give sufficient conditions for inclusion in the concept class given by the conclusion—both types of change are, at their heart, conceptual change. Change in legal concepts is essential to the dynamism of law. Legal concepts are what philosophers call “open textured” [28]: they cannot be defined by necessary and sufficient conditions which are universally valid over their domain of application. Rather, at least according to Hart’s theory, legal concepts have a “core of settled meaning” in which there is little debate over interpretation and a “penumbra” in which interpretation is debatable. Legal rules derive their dynamic nature in part through the dynamic, open-textured nature of the terms used in the rules. As new situations arise, interpretation of the meaning of these terms changes as well. So not only can rules change when new prerequisites, exceptions, or conclusions arise, but also when new interpretations of terms used in the rule are made as cases are decided and rules are applied. In this sense, reasoning in legal cases can be compared with a learning system. The rules and their constituent terms change in light of the experience of deciding new cases. Legislatures, agencies and courts, however, differ dramatically in how they change legal rules. Legislatures and agencies tend to effect structural changes of rules. Courts promulgate rules and definitions, too, and thus they also perform structural changes, but in addition, a court may change the meaning of a rule’s constituent terms as it applies the rule in deciding a new problem. Since only courts apply rules in deciding specific fact situations, only a court can change the meanings of a rule’s constituent terms as well as a rule’s structure as it applies the rule.1 If courts and legislatures can simply adjust legal rules in light of the acceptability of their applications, one might argue that nothing can be learned in such a process. That is, if “the law” does not exist independently of the formulations of legislatures and the pronouncements of judges, it might be argued that they create rather than discover the law. Presumably, this would be different from a machine learning program that may discover a new law of physics from instances of its application but does not create one. While this argument raises a philosophical issue of considerable depth, it does not give sufficient weight to the complex constraints on courts, and even on legislatures, in formulating and adjusting legal rules. Lawmakers must accommodate developing ethical norms, economic and political principles, social policies, public expectations, past commitments and decisions, language-related conventions, and technological advances. Jurisprudential scholars like Levi, Dworkin, Sunstein, and Brewer, describe processes of discovering legal rules, subjecting them to rigorous scrutiny in light of these complex criteria, and evaluating the tradeoffs rules effect. In this sense, formulating legal rules is a process of discovering what will work in accommodating these criteria, not creating arbitrary norms out of whole cloth with no consequences. In any event, whether one believes “the law” is a learning system or not, there are interesting relations between legal reasoning and learning. As discussed below, what courts and legislatures do at various points in the process has many affinities with what is done when attempting to learn rules from examples.
