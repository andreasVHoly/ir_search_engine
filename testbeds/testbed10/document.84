Applications of symbolic machine learning to ecological modelling 

Sasˇo Dzˇeroski *

Symbolic machine learning methods induce explicitly represented symbolic models from data. This is in contrast to methods like neural networks, which most often produce black-box models. Models constructed by symbolic machine learning can be inspected, modified, used and verified by human experts and have the potential to become part of the knowledge in the respective application domain. Symbolic machine learning methods include the induction of decision trees for classification and regression, algebraic, differential and partial differential equations, and classification rules, including relational rules (also known as inductive logic programming). They heuristically search the space of possible models to identify models appropriate for the data at hand. Applications of symbolic machine learning methods to ecological modelling problems are numerous and varied. They range from modelling algal growth in lagoons and lakes (e.g. in the Venice lagoon), through modelling interactions of a red deer population with the new growth in a forest, to habitat-suitability modelling for pronghorn antelopes, brown bears, and Collembola. This paper gives an overview of machine learning applications to ecological modelling, focussing on applications of symbolic machine learning. It gives more detailed accounts of several such applications. Symbolic machine learning methods are not described in detail but rather illustrated through the presented applications.

5. Conclusion

Symbolic methods have been successfully applied to many problems in environmental science, engineering and management. Of the case studies presented here, the results of applying symbolic machine learning methods are most directly relevant to practice in the red deer population modelling case. These applications have also raised a number of issues of concern to developers of symbolic machine learning methods. These include problems of data quantity (handling large datasets, generalize from small datasets), data quality (handling missing data, noisy data), and handling nonstandard learning tasks (where the data do not necessarily reside in a single fixedwidth table, e.g. information on chemical structures, images). Especially important is the problem of using existing domain knowledge in the learning process.
