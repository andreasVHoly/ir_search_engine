A survey of kernel and spectral methods for clustering


Maurizio Filipponea,∗, Francesco Camastrab, Francesco Masullia, Stefano RovettaaUnsupervised data analysis using clustering algorithms provides
a useful tool to explore data structures. Clustering methods
[1,2] have been addressed in many contexts and disciplines
such as data mining, document retrieval, image segmentation
and pattern classification. The aim of clustering methods is to
group patterns on the basis of a similarity (or dissimilarity)
criteria where groups (or clusters) are set of similar patterns.
Crucial aspects in clustering are pattern representation and the
similarity measure. Each pattern is usually represented by a
set of features of the system under study. It is very important
to notice that a good choice of representation of patterns can
lead to improvements in clustering performance. Whether it is
possible to choose an appropriate set of features depends on the
system under study. Once a representation is fixed it is possible to choose an appropriate similarity measure among patterns.
The most popular dissimilarity measure for metric representations
is the distance, for instance the Euclidean one [3].
Clustering techniques can be roughly divided into two categories:
• hierarchical;
• partitioning.
Hierarchical clustering techniques [1,4,5] are able to find structures
which can be further divided in substructures and so on recursively.
The result is a hierarchical structure of groups known
as dendrogram.

6. Conclusions
Clustering is a classical problem in pattern recognition. Recently
spectral and kernel methods for clustering have provided
new ideas and interpretations to the solution of this problem.
In this paper spectral and kernel methods for clustering have
been reviewed paying attention to fuzzy kernel methods for
clustering and to the connection between kernel and spectral
approaches. Unlike classical partitioning clustering algorithms
they are able to produce nonlinear separating hypersurfaces
among data since they construct an adjacency structure from
data. These methods have been successfully tested on several
benchmarks, but we can find few applications to real world
problem due to the high computational cost. Therefore an extensive
validation on real world applications remains a big challenge
for kernel and spectral clustering methods.
