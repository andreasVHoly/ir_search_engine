ML techniques embody some of the facets of the human mind that allow us to solve hugely complex problems at speeds which outperform even the fastest computers (Schank, 1982). ML techniques have been used successfully in solving many diffcult problems such as speech recognition from text (Sejnowski and Rosenberg, 1987), adaptive control (Narendra and Parthasarathy, 1987; Hegazy and Moselhi, 1994) and markup estimation in the construction industry (Hegazy and Moselhi, 1994). Recently ML approaches have been proposed as an alternative way of predicting software effort. This section describes three ML techniques that could be used in effort estimation: ANNs, CBR and RI. These techniques have been selected on the grounds that there exists adequate software tool support and because of their contrasting vantage points.

6. Conclusions In this paper we have compared three machine learning techniques with a LSR model for predicting software project effort. These techniques have been compared in terms of accuracy, explanatory value and con®gurability. Despite ending that there are derences in prediction accuracy levels, we argue that it may be other characteristics of these techniques that will have an equal, if not greater, impact upon their adoption. We note that the explanatory value of both estimation by analogy (case-based reasoning) and rule induction, gives them an advantage when considering their interaction with end-users. We also have found that problems of con®guring neural nets tend to rather counteract their superior performance in terms of accuracy. This preliminary research has shown the need for further investigation, particularly in ®nding appropriate con®guration heuristics for neural nets. Whilst some heuristics have been published (e.g. Walczak and Cerpa, 1999), we unfortunately did not ®nd them to be of great value for this particular prediction task. In terms of prediction accuracy, the ML techniques we used are locally signi®cant and are not generalisable. Nevertheless we believe that these ML methods warrant further investigation, particularly to explore under which conditions they are most likely to be effective.
