Breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer death in women between the ages of 40 and 55 1 . Curently, there is no certain way to prevent breast cancer (Breast Cancer Facts, 2002). This is one reason of why early detection represents a very important factor in its treatment and consequently the survival rate. Digital mammography is considered to be the most reliable method of early detection, however, in the early stage, the visual clues are subtle and varied in appearance, making diagnosis difficult, challenging even for specialists. In mammography breast abnormalities are divided into exhibiting microcalcification, circumscribed lesions and spiculated lesions. Microcalcification appears as a small bright spot on the mammogram. Most of the minimal breast cancers are detected by the presence of microcalcifications (Chitre et al., 1993). It is however difficult to distinguish between benign and malignant microcalcifications. To decide whether a suspicious area on a digital mammogram contains benign/malignant microcalcifications, traditionally the tissue has to be removed for examination using breast biopsy techniques. The computer classification system of the microcalcifi- cations can provide a second opinion to the radiologists and reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies. A digital mammogram brought the possibility of using computer-aided diagnosis system. Current image processing techniques make microcalcification detection easier, however classi- fication of malignant and benign microcalcifications is still very challenging and a difficult problem for researchers. One important factor directly affects the classification result is feature extraction. Researchers spend a lot of time in attempt to find a group of features that will aid them in improving the classification for malignant microcalcifications from benign. In the literature, region-based features (Chitre et al., 1993; Zheng et al., 1994), shape-based features (Shen et al., 1994; Jiang et al., 1996; Shen et al., 1994), image structure features (Chitre et al., 1993; Zokos, 1998; Verma, 1998, 1999; Kevin et al., 1993; Chris and Tina, 1997), texture based features (Marialuiza et al., 2001; Marcoz and Torres-Torriti, 2001), and position related features (Maria-luiza et al., 2001) are described and used for experiments. One feature taken alone might not be significant for the classification but might be very significant if combined with other features. The whole set of the features may include the redundant or irrelevant information. Ho (1998), combined and constructed multiple classifiers using randomly selected features which can achieve better performance in classification than using the complete set of features. The only way to guarantee the selection of an optimal feature vector is an exhaustive search of all possible subset of features. However, search spaces to be explored could be very large. For N features, the number of possible subsets is 2N. Feature subset selection is defined as a process of selecting a subset of features out of the larger set of features, which maximize the classification performance of a given procedure over all possible subsets. The objective of this paper is to propose and investigate a neural-genetic algorithm in conjunction with neural and statistical classifiers to find the most significant features or the sets of features suitable for classifying abnormalities of microcalcifications. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the work has been done in this area. Section 3 describes the proposed research methodology. The experimental results are presented in Section 4. Section 5 discusses the obtained results by the proposed technique. The conclusion and future directions are stated in the final section.
