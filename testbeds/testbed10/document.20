Subcellular protein sorting, i.e. the processes through which proteins are routed to their proper final destination within a cell, is a fundamental aspect of cellular life. In many cases, sorting depends on ‘signals’ that can already be identified by looking at the primary structure of a protein. Thus, targeting to the secretory pathway, to mitochondria and to chloroplasts normally depends on an N-terminal presequence or targeting peptide that can be recognized by receptors on the surface of the appropriate organelle. After targeting, membrane-embedded translocation machineries ensure the delivery of the protein to the interior of the organelle. By definition, the cell can recognize all kinds of protein sorting signals with almost 100% selectivity and specificity— the level of mis-sorting in vivo appears to be very low, although this aspect of the problem has not been studied in detail. Given that the sorting signals mentioned above seem to be, at least to a good approximation, defined by a linear, N-terminal stretch of the polypeptide, it would appear that we should be able to devise sequence-based methods that can recognize these signals with an efficiency approaching that of the cell itself. If such methods can be developed, they will clearly be of major use for genome analysis and automatic database annotation; at the same time, these massive data analysis tasks necessitate very accurate prediction methods. While prediction of sorting signals has a long history, started by the early work on secretory signal peptides (von Heijne, 1983; McGeoch, 1985; von Heijne, 1986b), it is only with the application of modern machine learning techniques, such as neural networks (NNs) and hidden Markov models (HMMs), that we seem to be approaching the necessary levels of accuracy (Baldi and Brunak, 1998; Durbin et al., 1998). Machine-learning techniques are ideally suited for pattern recognition tasks where relatively large amounts of data are present and where the patterns are ‘noisy’ and not easily described by a compact set of rules. The fundamental idea behind these approaches is to learn to discriminate automatically from the data, using experimentally verified examples, which most often are extracted from large public sequence and structure databases. While HMMs are best at recognizing, in an ‘elastic’ fashion, the sequential pattern in the amino acids or nucleotides, the NN algorithms are better at handling sequence features correlated over a longer range, especially if there is some degree of conservation in the positioning of the relevant features. Together, the NN and HMM methods can therefore handle a very substantial part of the sequence diversity created by evolution that is characteristic for many complex biological mechanisms. Thus, there now exist quite reliable machine learning-based methods for the identification of both secretory signal peptides (SPs), mitochondrial targeting peptides (mTPs) and chloroplast transit peptides (cTPs). In this review, we will concentrate on the present status and future perspectives of SP prediction—in particular the developments and applications of our own method, SignalP, since it was published in Protein Engineering two years ago (Nielsen et al., 1997a). Several NN-based methods for prediction of SPs have been developed (Ladunga et al., 1991; Schneider and Wrede, 1993), but only SignalP is publicly available. SignalP has been used extensively since it was made available over the internet, but the first version has some important shortcomings that necessitate further development and integration with other prediction methods. In addition, we will review a couple of methods for predicting other protein sorting signals, and discuss some general aspects of sorting signal prediction.
