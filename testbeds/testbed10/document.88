1. Introduction In recent years, the increasing use of e-mail has led to the emergence and further escalation of problems caused by unsolicited bulk e-mail messages, commonly referred to as Spam. Evolving from a minor nuisance to a major concern, given the high circulating volume and offensive content of some of these messages, Spam is beginning to diminish the reliability of e-mail (Hoanca, 2006). Personal users and companies are affected by Spam due to the network bandwidth wasted receiving these messages and the time spent by users distinguishing between Spam and normal (legitimate or ham) messages. A business model relying on Spam marketing is usually advantageous because the costs for the sender are small, so that a large number of messages can be sent, maximizing the returns, this aggressive behavior being one of the defining characteristics of Spammers (those that send Spam messages) (Martin-Herran, Rubel, & Zaccour, 2008). The economical impacts of Spam have led some countries to adopt legislation (e.g., Carpinter & Hunt, 2006; Hoanca, 2006; Stern, 2008), although it is limited by the fact that many such messages are sent from various countries (Talbot, 2008). Besides, difficulties in tracking the actual senders of these messages can also limit the application of such laws. In addition to legislation, some authors have proposed changes in protocols and operation models (discussed in Hoanca (2006)). Another approach adopted is the use of Spam filters, which, based on analysis of the message contents and additional information, attempt to identify Spam messages. The action to be taken once they are identified usually depends on the setting in which the filter is applied. If employed by a single user, as a client-side filter, they are usually sent to a folder which contains only Spam-labeled messages, making the identification of these messages easier. In contrast, if the filter operates in a mail server, handling messages from several users, they may either be labeled as Spam or deleted. Another possibility is a collaborative setting, in which filters running in different machines share information on the messages received, to improve their performance. However, the use of filters has created an evolutionary scenario (Goodman, Cormack, & Heckerman, 2007; Hayes, 2007), in which Spammers employ tools (Stern, 2008) with various techniques specifically tailored to minimize the number of messages identified. Initially, Spam filters were based on user-defined rules, designed based on knowledge of regularities easily observed in such messages. In response, Spammers then began employing content ‘‘obfuscation” (or obscuring), by disguising certain terms that are very common in Spam messages (e.g., by writing ‘‘f r 3 3” instead of ‘‘free”), on an attempt to prevent the correct identification of these terms by Spam filters. Nowadays, Spam filtering is usually tackled by machine learning (ML) algorithms, aimed at discriminating between legitimate and Spam messages, providing an automated, adaptive approach, which are the focus of this review. Instead of relying on hand-coded rules, which are prone to the constantly changing nature of Spam messages, ML approaches are capable of extracting knowledge from a set of messages supplied, and using the obtained information in the classification of newly received messages. Given a collection of training documents Dtr D labeled as legitimate or Spam, these algorithms can be described as learning a function f : D ! fl; sg, for labeling an instance (document or message) d 2 D as legitimate ðlÞ or Spam ðsÞ, referred to as the classes. Another interesting feature of these algorithms is the ability to improve their performance through experience (Mitchell, 1997). Due to the fact that most practical filters employ a combination of ML and application-specific knowledge, in the form of hand-coded rules, understanding the changing characteristics of Spam is also important, and has been considered by some researchers (Gomes, Cazita, Almeida, Almeida, & Meira, 2007; Pu & Webb, 2006; Wang & Chen, 2007). Nevertheless, despite the growing research on Spam filtering, the evolution of Spam messages is still occurring, which can be seen in the development of new techniques for evading recognition, such as messages with contents embedded in images. Text-based Spam filtering can be considered as a text categorization problem, and some works have been designed not only for Spam filtering, but also for the problem of sorting messages into folders (e-mail categorization). However, Spam filtering has several distinguishing characteristics, which should be incorporated in a system for ensuring its applicability. As discussed by Fawcett (2003), these include skewed and changing class distributions, unequal and uncertain misclassification costs of Spam and legitimate messages, complex text patterns and concept drift (a change in a target concept, such as terms indicative of Spam messages) and provide the opportunity for the development and application of new algorithms that explore these characteristics (Fawcett, 2003). Moreover, special attention should be given to the role of user feedback, in the form of immediate or delayed corrections for updating the classification model, as a way to deal with concept drift. In particular, user feedback is a growing theme not only in Spam filtering, but also in other areas of text processing (Culotta, Kristjansson, McCallum,& Viola, 2006). Spam filtering is also increasingly considered as a benchmark for testing newly developed machine learning algorithms, not specifically designed for this problem (e.g. Camastra & Verri, 2005; Gadat & Younes, 2007; Qin & Zhang, 2008). In line with the growing concerns regarding Spam messages, there has been an increasing number of works dedicated to the problem. Wang and Cloete (2005) surveyed some approaches for e-mail classification, including Spam filtering and e-mail categorization. A relatively recent overview of approaches aimed at Spam filtering was presented by Carpinter and Hunt (2006), which focused on more general aspects of the problem. A more recent review has been conducted by Blanzieri and Bryl (2008). However, it did not discuss several of the more recent works, such as CaseBased Reasoning models and Artificial Immune Systems, which are included in this paper. Moreover, in the present review, we discuss two important aspects not widely considered in the literature: the bias imposed by the commonly used bag-of-words representation and an important difference between naive Bayes models. We also discuss the need to evaluate a filter in a realistic setting, according to some recent corpora available. Emphasis is given to recent works, minimizing the overlap with other reviews (Blanzieri& Bryl, 2008; Carpinter & Hunt, 2006; Wang & Cloete, 2005), although some early works proposing the use of some approaches are also discussed to outline the evolution of their use. Finally, although unsolicited content is current affecting not only e-mail, but also search engines (Gyongyi & Garcia-Molina, 2005) and blogs (Kolari, Java, Finin, Oates, & Joshi, 2006), this survey focuses solely on dealing with e-mail Spam. This paper is organized in the following way: Section 2 presents an initial background of Spam filtering, discussing typical steps involved in most filters, the representation of messages, datasets used for evaluation and performance measures usually adopted. Sections 3–10 discuss different families of algorithms applied to textual-related analysis of message contents, while Section 11 presents works dedicated to comparing filters under the same experimental setup. Section 12 focuses on approaches developed for dealing with image Spam. We attempt to present only the most distinguishing characteristics of each algorithm, and focus on the application-specific aspects and experimental scenarios considered. Special attention is given to the datasets used, as different corpora have different number of messages and characteristics. Finally, Section 13 presents an overall discussion of the methods cited in this review, along with the final conclusions of this work.
