1. Introduction
Local communities of coral reef fishes are influenced by a complex mix
of global biogeographic patterns (Harrison & Cornell, 2008), stochastic
recruitment pulses (Sale, 1977), and interactions between the fishes and
their habitat operating at a range of spatial scales. This multi-scale
complexity presents a challenge for the development of spatially explicit
predictive models of the fish community, which could greatly aid spatial
planning and conservation management of coral reef environments
(Mellin et al., 2009; Pittman et al., 2009). Despite the complexity, field
studies have established statistical relationships between several aspects
of the local habitat and its fish community. The structural complexity of
the substrate positively correlates with fish species richness, abundance
and biomass, while live coral cover influencesfish abundance, particularly of species directly dependent on the corals for food or shelter (Jones et al.,
2004). Depth influences the composition and abundance of the fish
community (Lara & González, 1998), and habitat complexity positively
correlates with species richness (Pittman et al., 2007a; Purkis et al., 2008).
In addition, location influences the fish community through factors such
as proximity to the reef edge or nearby rivers (Friedlander & Parrish,
1998) and proximity to nursery habitat such as seagrass beds and
mangrove stands (Dorenbosch et al., 2005; Mumby et al., 2004a). The
strength of the specific statistical relationships varies between studies, as
does the spatial scale at which the relationships are strongest (Mellin
et al., 2009). Nevertheless, the existing body of field studies suggests a list
of habitat variables that, if estimated by remote sensing instruments,
would enable the development of spatially explicit predictive models of
fish communities (Knudby et al., 2007). Five of these variables deserve
further attention as they are as possible to map with remote sensing:
depth, structural complexity, substrate type, habitat diversity, and live
coral cover. Methods for deriving water depth from both passive optical
(Lyzenga, 1978; Maritorena et al., 1994; Stumpf et al., 2003) and lidar remote sensing (Guenther, 2001) are well established, although the
maximum depths at which both methods can be applied are limited by
water turbidity. Digital elevation models can be created from such
spatially distributed depth measurements (Storlazzi et al., 2003), and
measures of structural complexity can be derived (Pittman et al., 2009).
Such measures of structural complexity have already been used to
produce spatial predictive models of fish species richness (Pittman et al.,
2007b). Substrate maps are the standard products from remote sensing of
coral reefs (Mumby et al., 1997), and have been combined with depth to
produce spatial predictions of fish community variables, both on coral
reefs (Mellin et al., 2007) and elsewhere (Herold et al., 2007). Habitat
diversity measures are straight-forward to calculate from substrate maps,
but their relationship with fish community variables has been little
explored. One study has found a significant relationship with fish species
richness (Purkis et al., 2008), while others have found the same
relationship to be non-significant (Pittman et al., 2004, 2007b). Live
coral cover has been more difficult to map with remote sensing, because
of sub-pixel heterogeneity and high spectral similarity between corals
and other substrate types such as algae and seagrass (Hochberg et al.,
2003). This causes live coral cover estimates to be highly dependent on
conditions such as water depth, turbidity, and the presence/absence of
spectrally similar substrate types (Hochberg & Atkinson, 2003; Mumby
et al., 2004b). Nevertheless, a few studies have had some success with
mapping live coral cover empirically, using either spectral indices (Joyce,
2004) or classification schemes based on the percentage of live coral cover
(Isoun et al., 2003; Newman et al., 2007). Despite field studies having
demonstrated relationships between live coral cover and fish community
variables, remotely sensed live coral cover has not yet been used for
predictive mapping of fish community variables. In this study, we derive remotely sensed estimates of depth,
structural complexity, habitat diversity and live coral cover. We derive
these estimates at a range of spatial scales and use them, along with a
substrate classification, a map of geomorphological reef zones, and a
map of boundaries of a local marine protected area, to develop spatial
predictive models for fish species richness, diversity, and biomass. We
compare the predictive performance (error) of six statistical and
machine-learning techniques used to model the fish–habitat relationships,
and we assess the influence of each predictor variable, and its
spatial scale, on model predictions. Finally, we use the best overall
model type to produce maps of each fish community variable, and
discuss the application of such maps for marine spatial planning.

5. Conclusion
The use of remote sensing allows predictive models of the fish
community to become spatially explicit and to cover large areas. In
addition, the spatial extent of IKONOS data allows users to derive
variables such as rugosity at coarse spatial scales not accessible with
traditional field-based methods, and to calculate entirely new
variables such as habitat diversity. However, the combination of
already weak statistical relationships between habitat variables and
the fish community and imperfect estimates of those variables using
IKONOS data causes noise in the spatially distributed predictions of
fish community variables. We have shown that models based on
habitat variables derived from IKONOS data can produce spatially
explicit predictions of fish species richness, biomass, and diversity,
and we have illustrated the improved predictive performance that
machine-learning algorithms such as the tree-based ensemble
techniques can achieve, compared to the less flexible linear models.
We have used the spatially explicit predictions to produce maps of the
fish community that, based on our knowledge of the area, reflect the
actual spatial distribution of the fish community. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to use satellite data to create predictive maps of
reef fish species richness, diversity, and biomass. The affordability of
satellite data allows such maps to be produced by organizations in
both developed and developing countries, where they can help
expand the scientific basis for decision-making in conservationoriented
marine spatial planning and potenti
