Single-objective and two-objective genetic algorithms for selecting linguistic rules for pattern classification problems

Fuzzy systems based on fuzzy if-then rules have been applied to various control problems [19, 28]. Fuzzy if-then rules in those fuzzy systems were usually derived from human experts. Recently, several approaches have been proposed for automatically generating fuzzy if-then rules from numerical data without domain experts (see, for example [29, 32, 35]). Genetic algorithms [3, 5] have been widely used for generating fuzzy if-then rules and tuning the membership functions of antecedent and consequent fuzzy sets. For example, Thrift [33], Feldman [1], and Kropp and Baitinger [18] employed genetic algorithms for generating fuzzy ifthen rules. Membership functions were adjusted by genetic algorithms in Karr [15], Karr and Gentry [16], Surmann et al. [30], and Herrera et al. [4]. Both the generation of fuzzy if-then rules and the tuning of membership functions were performed by genetic algorithms in Kinzel et al. [17], Satyadas and Krishnakumar [26], Homaifar and McCormick [6], and Park et al. [24]. The number of fuzzy if-then rules was also determined by genetic algorithms in Nomura et al. [22], Liska and Melsheimer [21], Lee and Takagi [20], and Ishigami et al. [14]. Hierarchical structures of fuzzy if-then rules were determined by genetic algorithms in Shimojima et al. [27]. In those genetic-algorithmbased approaches, a rule set (i.e., a rule table) of fuzzy if-then rules was coded as an individual. On the other hand, a single fuzzy if-then rule was coded as an individual in fuzzy classifier systems of Valenzuela-Rendon [34] and Parodi and Bonelli [25]. The above-mentioned approaches were mainly applied to fuzzy control problems such as cart centering problems [ 1,4, 6, 15, 17, 18, 20, 33], a pH control problem [16], a spacecraft attitude control problem [26], a truck backing problem [6], and a dc series motor control problem [24]. Some approaches were applied to function approximation problems [14, 21, 22, 25, 27, 30, 34]. Fuzzy systems based on fuzzy if-then rules have also been applied to pattern classification problems. Ishibuchi et al. [11] proposed a generation method of fuzzy if-then rules from numerical data for pattern classification problems, and Nozaki et al. [23] proposed a learning method of the generated fuzzy if-then rules. Genetic algorithms were used in Ishibuchi et al. [12, 13] for selecting a small number of fuzzy if-then rules with high classification performance. In genetic-algorithm-based rule selection methods [12, 13], the following fuzzy ifthen rules were used as candidate rules for an n-dimensional pattern classification problem: 

Rule R j: If Xpl is /l jl and ... and xp,, is Aj, then xp is Class Cj with CF= CFj, .j= l,2 ..... N, (1) where Rj is a label of rule, xp = (Xpl ..... xr, ) is an n-dimensional pattern vector, Aji is an antecedent fuzzy set on the i-th axis of the pattern space, Cj is a consequent class, CFj is the grade of certainty, and N is the total number of candidate rules. Because various fuzzy sets shown in Fig. 1 were used as antecedent fuzzy sets in the rule selection methods [12, 13], the linguistic interpretation of selected fuzzy if-then rules was not always easy. In order to select fuzzy if-then rules that can always be interpreted linguistically, Ishibuchi et al. 

In this paper, we proposed genetic-algorithmbased methods for constructing a compact fuzzy classification system with a small number of linguistic classification rules. We first formulated a rule selection problem of linguistic classification rules with two objectives: to maximize the number of correctly classified training patterns and to minimize the number of selected rules. Then we proposed three methods based on a single-objective genetic algorithm for finding a set of non-dominated solutions of the rule selection problem. Walso proposed a method based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm. By computer simulations on the iris data, we showed that a slightly better set of non-dominated solutions was obtained by the multi-objective genetic algorithm than the singleobjective genetic algorithm. Finally we proposed a hybrid algorithm by combining a learning method of linguistic classification rules with the multi-objective genetic algorithm. By computer simulations on the iris data, we showed that the combination of the learning algorithm had an effect on improving the classification performance of selected rules. When we construct a compact fuzzy classification system with high classification performance for a specific pattern classification problem, first a set of non-dominated solution of the rule selection problem are found by the proposed methods, then one of the non-dominated solutions is chosen depending on the preference of human users. The proposed methods can be also viewed as knowledge acquisition tools because classification knowledge is automatically extracted from numerical data as a small number of linguistic classification rules. Because the number of selected rules by the proposed methods is small, human users can carefully examine all the selected rules. If hundreds of rules are selected, it is practically impossible for human users to examine all the selected rules carefully. In the proposed methods, human users can also easily understand each rule because the selected rules are linguistic rules. This clarity of the selected rules is the main advantage of the proposed rule selection methods.
