1. Overview
Algorithms for constructing decision trees are among the most well known and widely
used of all machine learning methods. Among decision tree algorithms, J. Ross Quinlan's
ID3 and its successor, C4.5, are probably the most popular in the machine learning
community. These algorithms and variations on them have been the subject of numerous
research papers since Quinlan introduced ID3. Until recently, most researchers looking
for an introduction to decision trees turned to Quinlan's seminal 1986 Machine Learning
journal article [Quinlan, 1986]. In his new book, C4.5: Programs for Machine Learning,
Quinlan has put together a definitive, much needed description of his complete system,
including the latest developments. As such, this book will be a welcome addition to the
library of many researchers and students.
Quinlan discusses a wide range of issues related to decision trees, from the core algorithm
for building an initial tree to methods for pruning, converting trees to rules, and
handling various problems such as missing attribute values. For each of these issues, he
gives a clear description of the problem, usually accompanied by an example, and he
describes how C4.5 handles it. The detailed examples are usually drawn from real data
sets, and they help greatly to illustrate each problem.
Quinlan also covers a number of limitations of C4.5, such as its bias in favor of rectangular
regions, and he discusses some ideas for extending the abilities of the algorithm.
Except for a brief survey in the first chapter, he does not discuss competing decision tree
construction algorithms (such as Breiman et al.'s CART method [1984]) or competing
classification methods, presumably because the book is not intended as a general survey
of learning algorithms. The book should be most useful as a tool for machine learning
researchers or as a supplementary text in an advanced undergraduate or introductory
graduate course. Quinlan does not assume any familiarity on the part of readers with any
previous work on decision trees, and be explains all the requisite concepts in the early
chapters. 

3. Concluding remarks
This is a very well-written book, and any reader not familiar with Quinlan's writings will
quickly discover that Quinlan's style is refreshingly clear. The examples are especially
helpful, as they provide concrete illustrations of many of the algorithmic details of"
C4.5. In part because the writing is so good, it would have been nice to have a longer
book in which he surveyed some of the substantial body of literature on decision trees,
such as pruning methods, alternative goodness criteria, and experimental results. It
would have been especially interesting to read what Quinlan thinks of the numerous
experiments comparing C4.5 and its predecessors to the other classification algorithms
that are commonly used in the research community. Even at its current length, though,
this book will be very useful to researchers and practitioners of machine learning. Anyone
intending to use C4.5 in their experiments or on a practical problem will find this book
an invaluable resource.
