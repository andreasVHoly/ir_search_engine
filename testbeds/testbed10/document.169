1. Introduction
The past decade has seen research into the use of machine learning to support user
modeling (ML for UM) pass through a period of decline and then resurgence, with
the research area at the close of the twentieth century more active and vibrant than
at any previous time. It is tempting to identify the start of the ML for UM winter
as being marked by the publication of Self's (1988) paper in which he asserted that
a search problem that appeared to underlie a direct machine learning approach
to inferring possible cognitive process models for a relatively simple modeling task
was `clearly intractable'. While the paper did not argue that student modeling
was intractable per se, the phrase `the intractable problem of student modeling',
taken from the title of that paper, has been oft repeated, perhaps with less attention
to the ¢ner detail of the argument within the paper than might be desired. Without
needing to ascribe causes to the ML for UM winter, it is notable that it was preceded
by a decade of much activity. Notable examples from this period include the work of
Brown and Burton (1978), Brown and VanLehn (1980), Gilmore and Self (1988),
Langley and Ohlsson (1984), Mizoguchi et al. (1987), Reiser et al. (1985), Sleeman
(1984), VanLehn (1982), and Young and O'Shea (1981), much of it in the area
of student modeling.* In contrast, the period 1988^1994 saw relatively little activity
in the area. A strong resurgence is evidenced however by a special issue of this journal devoted to the subject (volume 8, numbers 1^2, 1998) the number of recent
workshops on the subject (Bauer et al., 1997; Bauer et al., 1999; Joachims et al.,
1999; Rudstorm et al., 1999; Papatheodorou, 1999), and sessions in major conferences
(Goettl et al., 1998; Jameson et al., 1997; Kay, 1999; Lajoie and Vivet, 1999.
It is, perhaps, tempting to equate the start of the thaw with the presentation of
the best paper award to Martin and VanLehn's (1993) paper on student modeling
at the 1993 World Conference on Arti¢cial Intelligence in Education.
While the ¢eld was initially dominated by research on student modeling, the
demands of electronic commerce and the world-wide-web have led to rapid growth
in research in the area of information retrieval. With vast quantities of information
available to all users on the web, the need for technologies to personalize the
web has arisen.
This paper provides a brief overview of the application of machine learning for
user modeling and reviews four critical issues that are currently limiting the real
world application of user modeling and looks at the current state of attempts to
overcome them. The four issues addressed are:
^ the need for large data sets;
^ the need for labeled data;
^ concept drift; and
^ computational complexity.

7. Conclusion
ML for UM has awoken from the winter of the early nineties with renewed strength
and vigor, fueled largely by the demands of the internet and other emerging information
retrieval technologies. However, despite clear potential and demand for
ML for UM technologies, they remain primarily in the research domain. We are
yet to witness the widespread appearance of ¢elded applications.
In this paper we have outlined four major issues that must be overcome before
widespread application of ML for UM will be possible:
^ the need for large data sets;
^ the need for labeled data;
^ concept drift; and
^ computational complexity.
While the dif¢culty of these problems should not be underestimated, as we indicate,
approaches to overcoming them are being actively pursued and strong progress
has been made. Looking forward it appears evident that ML for UM is a research
area on the cusp of coming-of-age and that by the time of the twentieth anniversary
of this journal, ML for UM will have taken a place as a core technology underlying
the information economy.
