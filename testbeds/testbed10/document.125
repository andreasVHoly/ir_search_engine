1. Introduction
Lidar remote sensing of canopies far goes beyond the proof-ofconcept
phase and thus far has become a well-established tool for
monitoring terrestrial ecosystems, with great potential for continued
technological advances (Reutebuch et al., 2005). Commercial airborne
lidar systems currently available, for example, can easily reach a pulse
repetition frequency of more than 100 kHz and some are even able to simultaneously manipulate multiple pulses in the air. Compared to
traditional remote sensing such as multispectral imaging and radar,
lidar (especially small-footprint airborne laser scanner) provides
superior capabilities for accurately measuring vegetation structure
with no apparent sign of saturation in predicting high biomass and leaf
area index (LAI) over dense forests (Koch, 2010). Such advantages spur
the increasing availability and widespread use of lidar data in canopy
studies, which, on the other hand, connotes the growing importance of
reliable vegetation information in practical and scientific applications
such as natural resource inventory and more interestingly, studies of
vegetation responses and functioning in a changing climate (Hurtt
et al., 2004). An early review of basic lidar principles in the context of
forestry applications is given in Lim et al. (2003b).

The recent use of lidar for characterizing forest landscapes
encompasses a wide array of applications targeted at estimating various
vegetation structural parameters across a range of scales (van Leeuwen
& Nieuwenhuis, 2010). These biophysical parameters include, but are
not limited to, individual tree dimension variables such as height, crown
width, crown base height, crown volume, and diameter at breast height
(dbh) (Coops et al., 2004; Popescu & Wynne, 2004; Falkowski et al.,
2006; Kato et al., 2009; Popescu & Zhao, 2008), and at the canopy level,
canopy height, fractional vegetation cover, LAI, total aboveground
biomass and component biomass, basal area, timber volume, and
canopy fuel parameters such as canopy base height, available canopy
fuel, canopy bulk density and coarse wood debris (Andersen et al., 2005;
Holmgren et al., 2003; Jensen et al., 2008; Næsset, 2002; Zhao et al.,
2009). Meanwhile, some studies used lidar to examine ecological roles
of vegetation for various purposes. For example, Quirino et al. (2009)
assessed the power of lidar-derived variables for directly predicting soil
respiration at several sites in a Virginia forest. Cook et al. (2009)
modeled plant productivity through the combined use of vegetation
variables derived from lidar and Quickbird. A recent study by Falkowski
et al. (2009) successfully classified forest succession stages in a complex,
mixed coniferous forest using lidar metrics. There also are several lidar
studies that derived useful indices for mapping wildlife habitat and
evaluating habitat suitability, especially for many endangered species
(Hyde et al., 2006). Overall, past experiences with forestry applications
accentuate the great potential of lidar for remotely measuring canopy
structures (Koch, 2010; van Leeuwen & Nieuwenhuis, 2010). Moreover,
part of these studies clearly articulate the virtues of integrating lidar
with other remote sensing data such as multispectral images (Erdogy &
Moskal, 2010), high-resolution (Mutlu et al., 2008) or hyperspectral
images, and radar backscattering data (Hyde et al., 2006), although a
few studies point out that for estimating some vegetation variables like
LAI, the gain from the combined use of lidar and multispectral data is
only marginal compared to the use of lidar alone (Jensen et al., 2008;
Zhao & Popescu, 2009), possibly due to the insufficiency of statistical
models used (Zhao & Popescu, 2009).
Regarding the processing and analysis of lidar data for canopy
information extraction, lidar users generally keep two aprons, one
laden with computational tools borrowed from disciplines such as
signal/image processing and pattern recognition (Falkowski et al.,
2006; Kato et al., 2009; Meng et al., 2009; Pang et al., 2008; Popescu &
Zhao, 2008), and another apron stocked with statistical analysis tools
for inferring relationships and making prediction (Andersen et al.,
2005; García et al., 2010; Næsset et al., 2005; van Aardt et al., 2006;
Zhao et al., 2009). The boundary between the two classes of tools is
not dichotomous and often, their use is complementary as has been
previously demonstrated (Popescu et al., 2002). A typical example
within the first class of tools is segmenting lidar point clouds or more
frequently, canopy height models for individual tree crown delineation,
of which maximum filtering, template matching, k-means
clustering, and the watershed transform are common algorithms
(Falkowski et al., 2006; Pang et al., 2008; Popescu et al., 2003). Other
studies customized computer algorithms to directly derive crown
base height and dbh of individual trees from lidar point clouds (Kato
et al., 2009; Popescu & Zhao, 2008). In contrast, the vast majority of
lidar research on canopy structural characteristics is built upon the
use of statistical tools taken from the second apron, and of particular
importance therein is not only the selection of appropriate statistical
procedures (e.g., models) but more important, the choice of effective
lidar predictors (i.e., metrics) (Lefsky et al., 2005; McRoberts et al.,
2010; Næsset, 2002). Typically, lidar metrics from discrete-return
data are obtained in a bookkeeping manner by first enumerating all
the points within an analysis unit (e.g., grid, plot, or stand) to select
part or all of the lidar points and then computing the desired statistics
as metrics from the selected lidar points (Næsset et al., 2005;
Reutebuch et al., 2005). Common lidar metrics include mean, median,
maximum and percentile heights, canopy density metrics, truncated mean height, quadratic mean height, variance in height, coefficient of
variation, etc. (Erdogy & Moskal, 2010; Lim & Treitz, 2004;
