1 Introduction
Automatic text classification has always been an
important application and research topic since the
inception of digital documents. Today, text
classification is a necessity due to the very large
amount of text documents that we have to deal with
daily.
In general, text classification includes topic based
text classification and text genre-based
classification. Topic-based text categorization
classifies documents according to their topics [33].
Texts can also be written in many genres, for
instance: scientific articles, news reports, movie
reviews, and advertisements. Genre is defined on
the way a text was created, the way it was edited,
the register of language it uses, and the kind of
audience to whom it is addressed. Previous work on
genre classification recognized that this task differs
from topic-based categorization [13].
Typically, most data for genre classification are
collected from the web, through newsgroups,
bulletin boards, and broadcast or printed news.
They are multi-source, and consequently have
different formats, different preferred vocabularies
and often significantly different writing styles even
for documents within one genre. Namely, the data
are heterogenous.
Intuitively Text Classification is the task of
classifying a document under a predefined
category. More formally, if i d is a document of the
entire set of documents D and {cc c 1 2 , ,..., n} is the
set of all the categories, then text classification
assigns one category j c to a document i d .
As in every supervised machine learning task, an
initial dataset is needed. A document may be
assigned to more than one category (Ranking Classification), but in this paper only researches on
Hard Categorization (assigning a single category to
each document) are taken into consideration.
Moreover, approaches, that take into consideration
other information besides the pure text, such as
hierarchical structure of the texts or date of
publication, are not presented. This is because the
main issue of this paper is to present techniques
that exploit the most of the text of each document
and perform best under this condition.
Sebastiani gave an excellent review of text
classification domain [25]. Thus, in this work apart
from the brief description of the text classification
we refer to some more recent works than those in
Sebastiani’s article as well as few articles that were
not referred by Sebastiani. In Figure 1 is given the
graphical representation of the Text Classification
process.  The task of constructing a classifier for
documents does not differ a lot from other tasks of
Machine Learning. The main issue is the
representation of a document [16]. In Section 2 the
document representation is presented. One
particularity of the text categorization problem is  that the number of features (unique words or
phrases) can easily reach orders of tens of
thousands. This raises big hurdles in applying many
sophisticated learning algorithms to the text
categorization
Thus dimension reduction methods are called for.
Two possibilities exist, either selecting a subset of
the original features [3], or transforming the
features into new ones, that is, computing new
features as some functions of the old ones [10]. We
examine both in turn in Section 3 and Section 4.
After the previous steps a Machine Learning
algorithm can be applied. Some algorithms have
been proven to perform better in Text Classification
tasks and are more often used; such as Support
Vector Machines. A brief description of recent
modification of learning algorithms in order to be
applied in Text Classification is given in Section 5.
There are a number of methods to evaluate the
performance of a machine learning algorithms in
Text Classification. Most of these methods are
described in Section 6. Some open problems are
mentioned in the last section. 

7 Conclusion
The text classification problem is an Artificial
Intelligence research topic, especially given the
vast number of documents available in the form of
web pages and other electronic texts like emails,
discussion forum postings and other electronic
documents.
It has observed that even for a specified
classification method, classification performances
of the classifiers based on different training text
corpuses are different; and in some cases such
differences are quite substantial. This observation
implies that a) classifier performance is relevant to
its training corpus in some degree, and b) good or
high quality training corpuses may derive
classifiers of good performance. Unfortunately, up
to now little research work in the literature has been
seen on how to exploit training text corpuses to
improve classifier’s performance.
Some important conclusions have not been
reached yet, including:
• Which feature selection methods are both
computationally scalable and high-performing
across classifiers and collections? Given the
high variability of text collections, do such
methods even exist?
• Would combining uncorrelated, but wellperforming
methods yield a performance
increase?
• Change the thinking from word frequency
based vector space to concepts based vector
space. Study the methodology of feature
selection under concepts, to see if these will
help in text categorization.
• Make the dimensionality reduction more
efficient over large corpus.
Moreover, there are other two open problems in
text mining: polysemy, synonymy. Polysemy refers
to the fact that a word can have multiple meanings.
Distinguishing between different meanings of a
word (called word sense disambiguation) is not
easy, often requiring the context in which the word
appears. Synonymy means that different words can
have the same or similar meaning.
