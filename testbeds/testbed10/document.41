International reports have communicated that BC is the most frequent malignancy in women worldwide [44,72]; this cancer has usually the top frequency of occurrence in affluent countries, while in developing countries it is frequently in second place, after cancer of cervix uteri [43]. Though Uruguay is a developing country, its age-adjusted rates for incidence—around 95 per 100 000 women—[44] as well as for mortality (28 per 100 000) are among the highest in the world [1]. Moreover, the relative frequency of this tumour in Uruguay represents currently 32% of all neoplasms among women [68,69], and mortality has been increasing over the last four decades [13]. A number of research works carried out in this country in recent years have accurately defined the BC problem [53,54,56,70]. Two of the most important findings were: the high frequency of gynecoobstetric risk factors (38% on average) among the female population of Uruguay [5], and the large delays until a physician is consulted after the clinical onset [52], a fact that frequently results in advanced stages of the disease. Due to the high incidence and prevalence of BC in developed countries, numerous analytical epidemiological studies whose goal was to identify risk factors for the disease have been carried out in such countries [22,26,31,45]. Menstrual and reproductive factors [7,32,33,66], family history of cancer [3,41], alcohol consumption [34,77], history of benign breast diseases [15,39] and use of hormones [6,36,38,47] have been studied and found to be associated with the risk increase of BC. Among the environmental factors which are probably the most relevant in relation to their influence on BC genesis and development, diet prevails notably [8,19,20,30,74–76,78]. Several communications on this point have been done in recent years in Uruguay, remarking on the role of red meat and saturated fat consumption, as well as the preparation methods of meat [54], heterocyclic amines consumption [14], dietary fiber from fruits and vegetables [11] and fatty acids consumption [12]. Among the considered strategies for the control of BC (primary prevention, secondary prevention or screening, and improvement of therapies), and according to the experience of several expert researchers, breast screening based on mammography appears to be a step in the control of the disease, taking into account the results which have shown important reductions of BC mortality [10,16,24,29,59,64]. Most of the screening programmes have had detection rates between 7–15 cancers per 1000 mammographies [24], and due to the fact that the detection rate under 50 years old is about one or less per 1000 [24], the inclusion of the age group of 40–49 is still under debate [24,27,28,60]. Although BC is an example of a typical multifactorial disease, age is still considered to be the main risk factor. Nevertheless, taking into account current detection rates of screening programmes as quoted above, age alone seems to be an insufficient discriminator, despite the considerations of establishing the initial screening age at 40 or 50 years old. Therefore, a developing country like Uruguay shares a common health problem with developed countries, but lacks an adequate health care system in order to fight A.L. Ronco / Artificial Intelligence in Medicine 16 (1999) 299–309 301 against the heavy burden that BC represents [48]. Considering the high costs of conventional screening programmes, it is convenient to analyse the feasibility of a selective BC screening, an operative modality supported by scientific rational basis [37,42,57,65]. Recently, the author communicated the results of a pilot study with that aim, where an arithmetic score was created based on sociodemographic, gynecoobstetric, dietary and family factors [50]. Due to the complex, non-linear associations among factors related with BC, we considered as more appropriate the use of artificial neural networks (ANN) to evaluate their discriminatory potential, in order to classify subsets of women populations into potentially high and low-risk of BC, to be further screened or not respectively. Within the specific area of BC, ANN have had contributions mainly in imagenology and laboratory [2,4,9,17,18,25,63,73] and also in clinical evaluation [58,46,35,51]. Nevertheless, epidemiology has not taken enough advantage of ANN up to now, with only very limited examples of published non-clinical epidemiologic papers [21,23,61,71], and even less—only one—oriented specifically to non-clinical cancer epidemiology [61]. No epidemiological papers specifically designed to identify BC high-risk populations using ANN have been published to date (June 1998) to our knowledge, except for the preliminary results of a pilot study also recently communicated by the author [49], based on a sample of 556 patients. Taking into account the possibility of improvement of the cost/effectiveness ratio of a screening programme—and therefore its feasibility from a practical viewpoint—the author decided to perform the present study.
