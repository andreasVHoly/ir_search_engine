Demand forecasting methods in a supply chain:
Smoothing and denoising

1. Introduction
Many investigations (e.g., Chen et al., 2000; Fransoo
and Wouters, 2000; Lee et al., 1997a, b; Metters, 1997;
Simchi-Levi et al., 2000) have shown that providing the
supplier upstream with centralized data can significantly
reduce costs in the supply chain. Such information
prevents all kinds of information distortions in a supply
chain. In addition, these investigations have shown that
the difference between the variability in centralized and
decentralized supply chains increases as we move up the
supply chain, i.e., as we move from the first link to the
higher links of the supply chain.
In this paper we use the following notation:
Pl
t production of link l at time period t
ISl
t initial stock of link l at time period t
Dl
t demand of link l at time period t

Dbt forecasted external demand for time period t
DDt denoised demand at time period t
Cl
t inventory or penalty costs of link l at time
period t
In our model we set the following assumptions for
each link (l) in the supply chain (t—time period):
1. At the time of initial observation the production, P0,
and the stock, IS0, of all links in the supply chain are
balanced.
2. The information in the supply chain is centralized—all
links in the supply chain are instantly aware of the
demand change in the market.
3. The production and the stock are nonnegative ðPtX0,
IStX0Þ.
4. The production and the change in production are not
bounded (except by nonnegativity in the previous
item).
5. Batches ordered at the time period t are available at the
beginning of the time period t þ 1 (lead times are
assumed to be 1 period).
6. Insufficiency of the stock level provokes the missing
amount of the products to be supplied from marketplace (assuming that a perfect substitute for our
product exists), which causes penalty costs.
7. Production ðPtÞþInitial stock ðIStÞ¼ðInternalÞ Demand
ðDtÞþ Final stock ðIStþ1Þ.
The costs of the supply chain are defined as the sum of
the inventory costs and the penalty costs for all links. We
assume the penalty costs to be higher than the inventory
costs, which is expressed by introducing a weight, a, that
is larger than 1. In other words, using the common
notation Xþ ¼ maxðX; 0Þ, the supply chain costs at the
time period t are expressed as (l—level of the supply chain
increasing from the manufacturer (l ¼ 1) towards suppliers;
n—total number of links in the supply chain; a41)
Ct ¼ Xn
l¼1
Cl
t ¼ Xn
l¼1

We set this equation as a measure of the forecasting
efficiency.
In the sequel we consider a centralized supply chain
with a manufacturer and one supplier (n ¼ 2), and with
weight, a, that causes penalty costs to be twice as high as
inventory costs (a ¼ 2).
A typical approach to the manufacturing process is an
orientation towards production. A decision making process
is based on some standard methods of forecasting
external demand. When estimates of predicted demand
are obtained, production levels for the following period t
are determined through a postulation: production levels
equal predicted external demand, i.e.,
Pl
t ¼ Dbt; l ¼ 1; 2. (2)
Then we have
IStþ1 ¼ ðPl
t þ ISl
t  Dl
tÞ
þ; l ¼ 1; 2, (3)
where D1
t stands for external demand and D2
t for internal
demand.
The second approach is inventory-oriented approach
(see Ferbar et al., in press (a)), which will be used in the
simulation that follows in this paper. To minimize
inventory costs, instead of determining production levels,
we determine inventory levels in such a manner that they
equal predicted external demand. The production levels
are adapted in order to accommodate these constraints.
Therefore, the initial condition for every period is
ISl
t ¼ Dbt; l ¼ 1; 2 (4)
from which we derive the following decision rules for
production:
Pl
t ¼ ðDbtþ1 þ Dl
t  ISl
tÞ
þ  ðDl
t  ISl
tÞ
þ; l ¼ 1; 2. (5)
Theoretically, in this case it is possible for the initial stock
of a certain period to fall below zero. Since this is not a
permissible condition, we introduce the concept of perfect
substitutes for a certain product, which is very common in
many real-world cases, e.g., engine oils, standard batteries
for home electronics, medical drugs and their generic
counterparts. When perfect substitutes take effect penalties
for this replacement are paid and are shown in
cumulative costs.


In the remaining part of the paper we present wavelet
denoising analysis in order to compare two different
demand forecasting models: the exponential smoothing
model and the wavelet denoising model.

5. Conclusion
In this paper a new approach to demand forecasting is
introduced, i.e., the wavelet denoising model. Our analysis
has shown that the use of wavelet denoising has an edge over the widely used exponential smoothing method costwise.
If the smoothing coefficient b is chosen wisely, the
difference between the two is minimal. However, because
there is no efficient way to find the optimal b in advance
and the wavelet denoising model works well in all cases,
the latter has a serious advantage over the exponential
smoothing model. The results can even be improved if the
chosen wavelet, the wavelet decomposition level and the
type of thresholding are chosen appropriately for given
data. Yet, the method of choosing these parameters
remains open to our future research.
