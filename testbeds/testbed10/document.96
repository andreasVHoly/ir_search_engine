Machine Learning for Detection and Diagnosis of Disease 

Paul Sajda

INTRODUCTION Machine learning, a subdiscipline in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), focuses on algorithms capable of learning and/or adapting their structure (e.g., parameters) based on a set of observed data, with adaptation done by optimizing over an objective or cost function. Machine learning and statistical pattern recognition have been the subject of tremendous interest in the biomedical community because they offer promise for improving the sensitivity and/or specificity of detection and diagnosis of disease, while at the same time increasing objectivity of the decision-making process. However, the early promise of these methodologies has resulted in only limited clinical utility, perhaps the most notable of which is the use of such methods for mammographic screening (1, 2). The potential impact of, and need for, machine learning is perhaps greater than ever given the dramatic increase in medical data being collected, new detection, and diagnostic modalities being developed and the complexity of the data types and importance of multimodal analysis. In all of these cases, machine learning can provide new tools for interpreting the high-dimensional and complex datasets with which the clinician is confronted. Much of the original excitement for the application of machine learning to biomedicine originated from the development of artificial neural networks (ANNs) (e.g., see 3), which were often proclaimed to be “loosely” modeled after computation in the brain. Although in most cases such claims for brain-like computation were largely unjustified, one of the interesting properties of ANNs was that they were shown to be capable of approximating any arbitrary function through the process of learning (also called training) a set of parameters in a connected network of simple nonlinear units. Such an approach mapped well to many problems in medical image and signal analysis and was in contrast to medical expert systems such as Mycin (4) and INTERNIST (5), which, in fact, were very difficult and time consuming to construct and were based on a set of rules and prior knowledge. Problematic with ANNs, however, is the difficulty in understanding how such networks construct the desired function and thus how to interpret the results. Thus, often such methods are used as a “black box,” with the ANN producing a mapping from input (e.g., medical data) to output (e.g., diagnosis) but without a clear understanding of the underlying mapping function. This can be particularly problematic in clinical medicine when one must also consider merging the interpretation of the computer system with that of the clinician because, in most cases, computer analysis systems are seen as adjunctive. As the field of machine learning has matured, greater effort has gone into developing a deeper understanding of the theoretical basis of the various algorithmic approaches. In fact, a major difference between machine learning and statistics is that machine learning is concerned with theoretical issues such as computational complexity, computability, and generalization and is in many respects a marriage of applied mathematics and computer science. An area in machine learning research receiving considerable attention is the further development and analysis of linear methods for supervised and unsupervised feature extraction and pattern classification. Linear methods are attractive in that their decision strategies are easier to analyze and interpret relative to nonlinearclassification and regression functions, for example, constructed by ANNs. In addition, a linear model can often be shown to be consistent, at least to first order, with underlying physical processes, such as image formation or signal acquisition. Finally, linear methods tend to be computationally efficient, and can be trained online and in real time. Particularly important for biomedical applications has been the development of methods for explicitly incorporating prior knowledge and uncertainty into the decision-making process. This has led to principled methods based on Bayesian inference, which are well suited for incorporating disparate sources of noisy measurements and uncertain prior knowledge into the diagnostic process. This review describes recent developments in machine learning, focusing on supervised and unsupervised linear methods and Bayesian inference, which have made significant impact in the detection and diagnosis of disease in biomedicine. We describe the different methodologies and, for each, provide examples of their application to specific domains in biomedical diagnostics.

CONCLUSION 

Machine learning has emerged as a field critical for providing tools and methodologies for analyzing the high volume, high dimensional and multi-modal data generated by the biomedical sciences. This review has provided only a condensed snapshot of applications of machine learning to detection and diagnosis of disease. Fusion of disparate multimodal and multiscale biomedical data continues to be a challenge. For example, current methods have difficulty integrating structural and functional imagery, with genomic, proteomic, and ancillary data to present a more comprehensive picture of disease. Ultimately, the most powerful and flexible learning machine we know of is the human brain. For this very reason, the machine learning community has become increasingly interested in neuroscience in an attempt to identify new theories and architectures that might account for the remarkable abilities of brain-based learning systems. In fact, Jeff Hawkins, a pioneer in the computer industry, has recently formed a company, Numenta Inc., to begin to develop and productize his theory of how the cortex represents and recognizes patterns and sequences(128). Perhaps, not so coincidentally, early implementation of his theory has been based on hierarchical Bayesian networks, much like those that have been discussed in this review. Thus, the next generation of systems for analyzing biomedical data might ultimately be based on hybrid algorithms that provide the speed and storage of machine systems with the flexibility of human learning.
