Artificial neural networks as a tool in ecological modelling, an introduction 

Sovan Lek a,*, J.F. Gue´gan b

Ecological modelling has grown rapidly in the last three decades. To build his models, an ecologist disposes a lot of methods, ranging from numerical, mathematical, and statistical methods to techniques originating from artificial intelligence (Ackley et al., 1985), like expert systems (Bradshaw et al., 1991; Recknagel et al., 1994), genetic algorithms (d’Angelo et al., 1995; Golikov et al., 1995) and artificial neural networks, i.e. ANN (Colasanti, 1991; Edwards and Morse, 1995). ANNs were developed initially to model biological functions. They are intelligent, thinking machines, working in the same way as the animal brain. They learn from experience in a way that no conventional computer can and they can rapidly solve hard computational problems. With the spread of computers, these models were simulated and later research was also directed at exploring the possibilities of using and improving them for performing specific tasks. In the last decade, research into ANNs has shown explosive growth. They are often applied in physics research like speech recognition (Rahim et al., 1993; Chu and Bose, 1998) and image recognition (Dekruger and Hunt, 1994; Cosatto and Graf, 1995; Kung and Taur, 1995) and in chemical research (Kvasnicka, 1990; Wythoff et al., 1990; Smits et al., 1992). In biology, most applications of ANNs have been in medecine and molecular biology (Lerner et al., 1994; Albiol et al., 1995; Faraggi and Simon, 1995; Lo et al., 1995). Nevertheless, a few applications of this method were reported in ecological and environmental sciences at the beginning of the 90’s. For instance, Colasanti (1991) found similarities between ANNs and ecosystems and recommended the utilization of this tool in ecological modelling. In a review of computer-aided research in biodiversity, Edwards and Morse (1995) underlined that ANNs have an important potential. Relevant examples are found in very different fields in applied ecology, such as modelling the greenhouse effect (Seginer et al., 1994), predicting various parameters in brown trout management (Baran et al., 1996; Lek et al., 1996a,b), modelling spatial dynamics of fish (Giske et al., 1998), predicting phytoplankton production (Scardi, 1996; Recknagel et al., 1997), predicting fish diversity (Gue´gan et al., 1998), predicting production/biomass (P/B) ratio of animal populations (Brey et al., 1996), predicting farmer risk preferences (Kastens and Featherstone, 1996), etc. Most of these works showed that ANNs performed better than more classical modelling methods.

4. Overview of the presented papers During the three days of the workshop on ANN applications in ecology, 45 oral communications and posters were presented. They were thoroughly discussed by 100 or so participants coming from 24 countries. The session started with the general review ‘state-of-the-art of ecological modelling with emphasis on development of structural dynamic models’ (Jørgensen, see paper in the next chapter). Then applications of ANNs in several fields of ecology were presented: primary production in freshwater and marine ecosystems (seven papers), remote sensing data (six papers), population and community ecology and ecosystems (six papers), global change and ecosystem sensitivity (six papers), fishery research in freshwater and marine ecosystems (four papers), evolutionary ecology and epidemiology (three papers), population genetics (two papers) and seven remaining papers which rather concerned the methodological aspects, i.e. improvement of ANN models in ecological modelling. Some of these papers have been selected for publication in this special issue. The aim of this special issue, as well as of this first workshop, was both to contribute to an improvement of methodology in ecological modelling and to stimulate the integration of ANNs in ecological studies. Most of the papers propose the use of a backpropagation algorithm in ANN models. Certain papers suggest improvement by including the Bayesian (see Vila et al.’ paper) or radial base functions (see Morlini’s paper). Only a few papers used unsupervised learning to model remote sensing data, microsatellite data, or marine ecology data (see Foody’s paper).
