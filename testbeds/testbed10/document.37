Neural networks are being widely used in many fields of study. This could be attributed to the fact that these networks are attempts to model the capabilities of human brains. Since the last decade, neural networks are being used as a theoretically sound alternative to traditional statistical models. Although neural networks (NNs) originated in mathematical neurobiology, the rather simplified practical models currently in use have moved steadily towards the field of statistics. A number of researchers have illustrated the connection of neural networks to traditional statistical methods. For example, Gallinari, Thiria, Badran, and Fogelman-Soulie (1991) have presented analytical results that establish a link between discriminant analysis and multilayer perceptrons (MLP) used for classi- fication problems. Cheng and Titterington (1994) made a detailed analysis and comparison of various neural network models with traditional statistical methods. They have shown strong associations of the feedforward neural networks with discriminant analysis and regression, and unsupervised networks such as self-organizing neural networks with cluster analysis. Neural networks are being used in areas of prediction and classification, areas where regression models and other related statistical techniques have traditionally been used. Ripley (1994) discusses the statistical aspects of neural networks and classifies neural networks as one of a class of flexible nonlinear regression methods. Sarle (1994) translates neural network jargon into statistical terminology and shows the relationship between neural networks and statistical models such as generalized linear models, projection pursuit and cluster analysis. They have explained that neural networks and statistics are not competing methodologies for data analysis and there is considerable overlap between the two fields. Warner and Misra (1996) have presented a comparison between regression analysis and neural networks in terms of notation and implementation. They have also discussed when it is advantageous to use neural network model in place of a parametric regression model, as well as some of the difficulties in implementation. Schumacher, Robner, and Vach (1996) and Vach, Robner, and Schumacher (1996) have presented a comparison between feedforward neural networks and the logistic regression. The conceptual similarities and discrepancies between the two methods are also analyzed. Some of the commonly used traditional statistical techniques applied for prediction and classification are multiple regression, discriminant analysis, logistic regression. These methods are being widely used in various applications due to their established methodology. However, neural networks are being used as an alternative to these traditional techniques and gaining popularity in recent years. This has led to a number of studies comparing the traditional statistical techniques with neural networks in a variety of applications. The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of such articles that compare neural networks with standard statistical methods used for prediction and classification problems. Some authors have already attempted a comprehensive survey of articles involving neural networks in different fields of applications. Wong, Bodnovich, and Selvi (1997) have provided a comprehensive review and analysis of the literature involving neural networks in business applications between 1988 and 1995 and Vellido, Lisboa, and Vaughan (1999) for the period of 1992â€“1998. Zhang and Huang (1995) have provided a survey of applications of neural networks in manufacturing area. Wong and Selvi (1998) have surveyed financial applications of neural networks and Krycha and Wagner (1999) have reviewed the applications of neural networks in management science. As the performance of a particular technique in comparison to other techniques depend on various factors like the size of the sample, the assumptions of the technique being met, the method by which results are validated, the measure used for comparison and whether significant difference exists in the results, this study makes an attempt to critically assess the literature with respect to the criteria mentioned above. The present study provides a review of articles comparing a particular class of neural networks namely, multilayered feedforward neural networks and standard statistical techniques namely, regression analysis, logistic regression and discriminant analysis used for prediction and classification problems. The next section deals with the survey of the relevant articles in various areas of applications. The results have been summarized in tables in Section 3, in order to enhance the readability and to provide a quick overview of the articles reviewed in this paper. The last section concludes this study and discusses certain issues pertaining to both neural networks and statistical techniques.
