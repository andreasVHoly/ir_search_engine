I. INTRODUCTION
MACHINE learning techniques have been successfully
applied to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems
[20], [35], [42]. These methods learn hypotheses from a large
amount of diagnosed samples, i.e., the data collected from
a number of necessary medical examinations along with the
corresponding diagnoses made by medical experts, to assist the
medical experts in making a diagnosis in the future.
To make the CAD systems perform well, a large amount
of samples with diagnosis are required for learning. Usually,
these samples can be easily collected from routine medical
examinations. However, making a diagnosis for such a large
amount of cases one by one places a heavy burden on medical experts. For instance, to construct a CAD system for breast
cancer diagnosis, radiologists have to label every focus in a
huge amount of easily obtained high-resolution mammograms.
This process is usually quite time consuming and inefficient.
One possible solution is to learn a hypothesis from a small
amount of samples that are carefully diagnosed by medical
experts (the labeled data) and then utilize a large amount of
readily available undiagnosed samples (the unlabeled data) to
enhance the performance of the learned hypothesis. In machine
learning, this technique is called learning with labeled and
unlabeled data.
An effective way to enhance the performance of the learned
hypothesis by using the labeled and unlabeled data together
is known as semisupervised learning [8], [32], [46], where an
initial hypothesis is usually learned from labeled data and then
refined with the information that is derived from the unlabeled
ones. Co-training [4] is an attractive semisupervised learning
paradigm, which trains two classifiers through letting them
label the unlabeled examples for each other. In co-training,
the data should be described by two sufficient and redundant
attribute subsets, each of which is sufficient for learning and
independent to the other given class label.
Although co-training has been already successfully applied
to some fields [4], [25], [30], the requirement on two sufficient
and redundant attribute subsets is too strong to be met in many
real-world applications. Goldman and Zhou [17] extended cotraining
by replacing the requirement on two sufficient and redundant
attribute subsets with the requirement on two different
supervised learning algorithms whose hypotheses partition the
instance space into a set of equivalence classes. Tenfold cross
validation is frequently applied to find the confident examples
to label in every training iteration and produce the final hypothesis,
which makes the learning process and prediction time
consuming.
In this paper, a new co-training-style algorithm named
Co-Forest, i.e., CO-trained Random FOREST, is proposed.
It extends the co-training paradigm by incorporating a wellknown
ensemble learning [13] algorithm named Random Forest
[7] to tackle the problems of how to determine the most confi-
dent examples to label and how to produce the final hypothesis.
Since ensemble learning has been successfully applied to many
medical problems [35], [41], [42], the particular setting enables
Co-Forest to exploit the power of ensemble for better performance
of the learned hypothesis in semisupervised learning.
Since Co-Forest requires neither that the data be described by
sufficient and redundant attribute subsets nor special learning
algorithms which frequently employ time-consuming cross validation
in learning, it could be easily applied in CAD systems.
Experiments on University of California, Irvine (UCI) data sets verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Case studies
on three medical diagnosis tasks and a successful application
to microcalcification cluster detection in digital mammograms
show that the undiagnosed samples are beneficial, and the
hypothesis learned by Co-Forest achieves remarkable performance,
although it is learned from a large amount of undiagnosed
samples in addition to only a small amount of diagnosed
ones. Hence, constructing CAD system with Co-Forest may
release the burden on medical experts for diagnosing a large
number of samples.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
briefly reviews semisupervised learning and ensemble learning.
Section III presents Co-Forest. Section IV reports the experimental
results on UCI data sets and case studies on three
medical diagnosis data sets. Section V describes the application
to microcalcification cluster detection in digital mammograms.
Finally, Section VI concludes this paper.

VI. CONCLUSION
In a computer-aided medical diagnosis, diagnosing the samples
for training a well-performed CAD system places heavy
burden on medical experts. Such burden could be released if
the learning algorithm could use unlabeled data to help in
learning. In this paper, the Co-Forest algorithm is proposed,
which can use undiagnosed samples to boost the performance
of the system that is trained from the diagnosed samples.
By extending the co-training paradigm, it exploits the power
of Random Forest, a well-known ensemble method, to tackle
the problem of selecting confident undiagnosed samples to
label and producing the final hypothesis. Experiments on UCI
data sets verify the effectiveness of Co-Forest. Case studies
on three medical data sets and a successful application to
microcalcification cluster detection for breast cancer diagnosis
show that the undiagnosed samples are beneficial in building
CAD systems, and Co-Forest is able to enhance the performance
of the hypothesis learned simply on a small amount
of diagnosed samples by exploiting the undiagnosed samples.
Since Co-Forest tends to underestimate the error rates of the
concomitant ensembles, finding an efficient method to properly
estimate the error rates of these ensembles will be done in the
future, which is anticipated to make Co-Forest perform better.
Another interesting future work is to enhance the performance
of Co-Forest by incorporating Query by Committee [33], an active learning [9] mechanism, such that more helpful information
can be provided by the diagnosis from medical experts
on certain undiagnosed samples. Such an idea of combining
semisupervised learning with active learning in co-training
paradigm has been applied for content-based image retrieval
[40]. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the diversity between
component classifiers is maintained based on the randomness
provided by Random Forest. This places constraints to the base
learner of Co-Forest and the scale of ensemble. In the future,
exploring a method to maintain the diversity of component
classifiers in any ensembles during the semisupervised learning
process will extend the idea of Co-Forest to more general cases,
such that it can be applied in more practical applications.
