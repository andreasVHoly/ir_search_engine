IS's Touch Panel PCs Utilize Open Platform Programming Languages With Integrated Hardware and Software for HMI Visualization, Allowing Efficient Integration Into Automation and Control

AIS's HMI Operator Panels Support .NET Programming Languages Including Visual Basic .NET, Visual C#, C++, and Many Other Programming Languages for Custom Automation and Control Systems

IRVINE, CA--(Marketwired - April 25, 2016) -  American Industrial Systems, Inc. (AIS) an innovator, designer and manufacturer of Human Machine Interface (HMI) Touch Panels, Operator Interface Terminals, Industrial Box PCs, and Industrial Thin Clients announces their Smart family of HMI Operator Panels support an extensive range of .NET programming languages. This family of intelligent, advanced PC-based rugged HMI touch Screens from AIS include their Premium, Standard and Compact Series, HMI, SCADA and MES applications in plants operations. By utilizing open architecture design, AIS's Industrial HMI Touch Panel Interfaces allow OEMs, systems integrators, and end-users to utilize .NET programming languages, including Visual Basic .Net, Visual C#, C++ and other programming languages as well for their HMI automation, control and monitoring systems.

Supporting .Net Programming Languages Allows AIS's Premium, Standard and Compact HMI Touch Panel PC Series to Deliver Total Connectivity Between People, Systems and Devices

As explained on the Microsoft Web site, "Microsoft .NET is a set of Microsoft software technologies for connecting information, people, systems and devices. It enables a high level of software integration through the use of Web services - small, discrete building block applications that connect to each other as well as to other larger applications over the Internet." Written in extensible markup language (XML), a universal language for data exchange, these Web services via AIS's powerful and smart, Open Touch Panel HMIs and touchscreens allow data communication across the Internet (or within intranets) between otherwise unconnected sources. XML, upon which all Web services are based, is an open industry standard managed by the World Wide Web Consortium. XML. The .NET Platform programming use .NET Framework services and features through a common set of unified classes. The .NET unified classes provide a consistent method of accessing the platform's functionality. With .Net Programming Languages and AIS's industrial, HMI Touch Panels, users no longer need to learn and master different API architectures to write applications. Visual Basic provides prototypes of some common project types, including:
