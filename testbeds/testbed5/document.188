A convention in St. Augustine would obviously be appropriate for restaurateurs, hoteliers, tour guides and the like. But how about tech geeks?

It turns out that all the best computer programers are not ensconced in northern California. Some of them are right here in St. Augustine this week — and perhaps longer.

On Thursday, the Ancient City Ruby Conference took place at the Casa Monica Hotel. The conference is for those who use Ruby for coding. It’s an “open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity,” according to a Ruby community website.

One of the speakers at the conference, Paola Perrotta, described Ruby as “designed for humans first, computers second.”

This is Perrotta’s second time presenting at the local conference, and he said interacting with other Ruby users is beneficial and entertaining for him.

“It’s a healthy mix of hard-core (technical) and fun stuff,” he said.

He said the modern coder community is more social than outsiders might think, adding that the days of tech workers churning out code in isolation are over.

“The public image is changing,” he said. “These days, you cannot work in this environment if you’re not a people person.

“If you walk into a company where people are writing computer code, you would see people talking all the time, two people working at the same computer, discussing and making decisions together. Having fun. It’s becoming more and more of a craft that requires communication skills.”

Among the websites that use Ruby on Rails — Rails being the framework for the use of Ruby — are Basecamp, GitHub, Shopify, Airbnb, Hulu and Zendesk, according to rubyonrails.org.

The conference is being hosted by Hashrocket, a Web development company focused on Ruby on Rails and iOS design and development that is based in Jacksonville Beach.

Hashrocket CEO Marian Phelan said her company has put together the conference for the past four years to enhance the knowledge of its own employees and simply engage the Ruby community.

“We felt that we’d like to put on a conference that we would like specifically to attend,” she said. “We felt it was a great privilege to be able to go and pick all the speakers that we wanted to see. We felt like this is a great opportunity to mix with and meet all of the people who are in our area or close to home and get to build relationships with speakers.”

While Phelan could have staged the convention closer to the company headquarters, she said having it in St. Augustine was a treat for her employees and a nice incentive for the attendees.

The Casa Monica’s location in the heart of downtown means easy access to restaurants and local attractions after the scheduled events.

“I think it’s a very good showcase for what Florida has,” Phelan said. “People are very nice here. This is a beautiful area. I’m really proud to say, ‘This is Florida and can you believe that we work in this beautiful area?’”

By bringing dozens of Ruby experts to the city, the conference has the potential to inspire new local tech businesses.

“St. Augustine isn’t a tech hub yet, but we feel like we’re putting or we’re at least associating the name with technology,” Phelan said. “Hopefully, we can grow it.”

Melissa Glasgow, St. Johns County’s director of economic development, said she’s a big fan of the conference because it exposes the technology community to the area.

One of her missions is to attract a diverse range of employers to the county so that the local economy is not so reliant on tourism.

“Many attendees of this conference include Web-based software designers and represent the types of companies we would love to attract to St. Johns County,” she said in an email to The Record. “This industry sector is highly valued for the higher wages they pay to attract technically skilled talent.”

With many people in the technology industry having a certain amount of flexibility in where they can live, Glasgow said the county is attractive to young entrepreneurs who seek a better quality of life than what is available in other places.

And top-rated schools are an obvious draw, as well.

“In many cases, workers in this industry are very creative young millenials with a great entrepreneurial spirit,” she said. “Tech companies want to locate in areas that they can recruit these creative types of workers. Who’s to say that these attendees won’t fall in love with St. Augustine after coming here year after year for these conferences and then try to figure out a way to live here and bring their business with them?”
