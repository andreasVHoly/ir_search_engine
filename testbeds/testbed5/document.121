Reflective languages[edit]
Main article: List of reflective programming languages
Reflective languages let programs examine and possibly modify their high level structure at runtime. This is most common in high-level virtual machine programming languages like Smalltalk, and less common in lower-level programming languages like C. Languages and platforms supporting reflection:

Rule-based languages[edit]
Rule-based languages instantiate rules when activated by conditions in a set of data. Of all possible activations, some set is selected and the statements belonging to those rules execute. Rule-based languages include:[citation needed]

awk
CLIPS
Constraint Handling Rules
Drools
GOAL agent programming language
Jess
OPS5
Prolog
ToonTalk – robots are rules
Mathematica
XSLT[citation needed]
Wolfram Language
