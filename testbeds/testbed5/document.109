Compiled languages[edit]
These are languages typically processed by compilers, though theoretically any language can be compiled or interpreted. See also compiled language.

ActionScript
Ada (multi-purpose language)
ALGOL (extremely influential language design – the second high level language compiler)
SMALL Machine Algol Like Language
Ateji PX, an extension of the Java language for parallelism
BASIC (some dialects, including the first version of Dartmouth BASIC)
BCPL
Blue
C (one of the most widely used procedural programming languages)
C++ (One of the most widely used object-oriented (OO) languages specially used in large scale, highly complex, high performance software systems)
C# (compiled into intermediate language, which generates a native image at runtime)
Ceylon (compiled into JVM bytecode)
CLIPPER 5.3 (programming Language for DOS-based software)
CLEO (Clear Language for Expressing Orders) used the compiler for the British Leo computers
COBOL
Cobra
Common Lisp
Crystal
Curl
D (Attempts a "C++ done right" philosophy)
DASL compiles into Java, JavaScript, JSP, Flex, etc., which are further compiled into a .war file
Delphi (Borland's Object Pascal development system)
DIBOL (Digital Interactive Business Oriented Language)
Dylan
eC
Eiffel (object-oriented language developed by Bertrand Meyer)
Sather
Ubercode
Emacs Lisp
Erlang
F# (compiled into intermediate language, which generates a native image at runtime)
Factor
Forth (professional systems, like VFX and SwiftForth)
Fortran (the first high-level, compiled language, from IBM, John Backus, et al.)
GAUSS
Go
Gosu (compiled into JVM bytecode)
Groovy (compiled into JVM bytecode)
Haskell
Harbour
Java (usually compiled into JVM bytecode although ahead-of-time (AOT) compilers exist that compile to machine code)
JOVIAL
LabVIEW
Mercury
Nemerle (compiled into intermediate language bytecode)
Nim
Objective-C
Pascal (most implementations)
Plus
Python (compiled into intermediate Virtual Machine bytecode)
RPG (Report Program Generator)
Rust
Scala (compiled into JVM bytecode)
Scheme (some implementations, e.g. Gambit)
SequenceL – purely functional, automatically parallelizing and race-free
Simula (the first object-oriented language, developed by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard)
Smalltalk generally compiled to platform independent bytecode that runs on a Virtual Machine
Swift
ML
Standard ML (SML)
Alice
OCaml
Turing
Vala (Compiler for the GObject type system)
Visual Basic (Earlier versions compiled directly to a native runtime. Recent .NET versions compile into intermediate language that is just-in-time compiled into a native image at runtime.)
Visual FoxPro
Visual Prolog
X++
X#
XL
Z++
