Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It’s helped build some of the most popular sites on the internet, including Google, Facebook, YouTube, Netflix, Amazon, and Twitter. For the aspiring web developer, a knowledge of Java is essential to furthering your career.

If you’re brand new to coding or just starting out, there are two ways you can go about pursuing your programming studies: learn a little bit of many different languages at once or focus on learning one language inside and out before transitioning to others. Anyone more interested in the former option should check out the deal we wrote about yesterday, which is still going on, but for those taking the latter path, StackSocial's Complete Java Programming Bootcamp is the perfect place to start.

The deal consists of 10 classes covering all aspects of Java programming. To start, there are two courses aimed to get those brand new to the language comfortable with its rules and syntax, giving you the basic knowledge you need to move through the rest of the classes. From there, you’ll get instruction on multithreading, design patterns, data structures, and more — all of this should help to get you ready for the professional world of programming.

Purchased individually these ten courses would cost $740, but through this deal you can enroll in all of these courses for just $69. For anyone committed to starting a career in coding, there's great value here.

Complete Java Programming Bootcamp, $69 (originally $740), available through StackSocial. [90% off]
