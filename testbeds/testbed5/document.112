Little languages[edit]
Little languages serve a specialized problem domain.

awk – can serve as a prototyping language for C (shares similar syntax)
Comet – used to solve complex combinatorial optimization problems in areas such as resource allocation and scheduling
SQL – has only a few keywords, and not all the constructs needed for a full programming language[1] – many database management systems extend SQL with additional constructs as a stored procedure language
Logic-based languages[edit]
See also: Category:Logic programming languages
Logic-based languages specify a set of attributes that a solution must have, rather than a set of steps to obtain a solution. Examples:

ALF
Alma-0
CLACL (CLAC-Language)
Curry
Fril
Janus
?Prolog (a logic programming language featuring polymorphic typing, modular programming, and higher-order programming)
Leda
Oz, and Mozart Programming System cross-platform Oz
Poplog
Prolog (formulates data and the program evaluation mechanism as a special form of mathematical logic called Horn logic and a general proving mechanism called logical resolution)
Mercury (based on Prolog)
Strawberry Prolog (standard Prolog with some extensions)
Visual Prolog (object-oriented Prolog extension)
