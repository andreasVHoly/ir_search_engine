BrainBasket launches free 150-hour course to teach programming languages


Can't tell the difference from constants to variables? Couldn't tell a stack from a pointer? Think a declaration is just something that is filed at the tax office?

Then programming knowledge, the so-called new language of the 21st century, is what is needed. Kyiv-based BrainBasket Foundation offers a three-month course to teach all comers the basics of programming to do just that.

The course is based on study programs designed for novices by Harvard University, Stanford University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Called Technology Nation, the course consists of two-hour lessons starting on March 1, 2016, which are to be held in the town libraries in 22 oblasts across Ukraine. Groups of 12-15 students will be formed in each oblast center.

Deputy chief presidential office head Dmytro Shymkiv described the initiative at a briefing in Kyiv on Dec. 3.

“In the future people will have to be able to read, write, speak and – now we can see it among our children – program,” Shimkiv said. “That’s the future for many people – to acquire a completely new skill, find a new well-paid job with better labor conditions and become a part of global society.”

The curriculum is focused on the most common programming languages like Java, C++, Ruby and others. Students will study basic lecturing material online, watch webinars and then undergo 150 hours of practical classes and nine lab tasks under the direction of experienced mentors. The most important knowledge will be taught during the evening classes.

Moreover, the foundation will provide a blended learning process in both English and Ukrainian.

According to BrainBasket CEO Vladimir Liulka, the project is mostly aimed at those who want to alter careers and plunge deeper into the information technology sphere.

However, the selection panel will prioritize people from 22 to 40 years old with families.

“Priority is given firstly to those who have higher, secondary and special educations – but not a technical one – and to those who have little children,” Liulka said. “If we help parents, we’ll help children as well.”

Registration started on Dec. 3 and will last until all students are selected for the program. Due to the simplicity of the application form, the organizers are anticipating up to 5,000 applications by the end of the first registration day. Since a maximum of 330 students can be chosen for the first course, Liulka says some of those not selected will be considered for the next round of the course in May 2016, while others will be excluded from selection.

To apply for the course, you have to fill in an online form on brainbasket.org/technology-nation. It consists of only ten simple questions. If the first course is successful, the foundation says it will continue rolling out the program. Liulka promises to have 40,000 students and about 100 teaching hubs around the country by the end of 2016.

Microsoft Ukraine, the Presidential Administration of Ukraine and Ukrainian hardware producer Navigator support the initiative and are to provide all of the required equipment and software.

The BrainBasket Foundation is a non-profit organization aimed at developing information technology education in Ukraine. It was established in April 2014 by volunteers from successful IT companies and supported by Ukrainian Economy Ministry and Kyiv City Council. The foundation’s aim is to train 100,000 IT specialists by 2020.
