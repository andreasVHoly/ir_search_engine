IQ Academy elective teaches media

Since the beginning of the school year, a new elective course at the online IQ Academy school has been available that teaches media production skills through a variety of free programs.

The IQ Academy STEAM Room is a weekly voluntary course taught by Fergus Falls Public Schools technology specialist Jesse Thorstad. STEAM stands for science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics.

The course focuses on how students can apply these concepts to computer programs that allow them to create websites, video games, videos and other media. The group covers a program in about four to six weeks. The students are from all over Minnesota, but IQ Academy is based of Fergus Falls Public Schools. 

“Since it’s not a required course, we gauge their interest and see how much they seem to be getting out of it and enjoying it,” Thorstad said.

For example, the students have a video game unit in the fall that introduced students to coding and programming. Through a program environment called Scratch, students drag and drop blocks of code to make animations and actions happen on the screen.

“It’s colorful and easy to understand, but it can also be complex,” Thorstad said. “It’s a perfect way to introduce students to the concepts of programming languages if they are going to go on to learn other programming languages.”

The sessions are taught with free programs found on the Internet so students can do these activities independently and continue to develop their skills if they have an interest. The lessons are framed like tutorials and often based around instructional videos to accompany that idea.

“The idea is to expose them to job opportunities and career interests,” he said. “You never know when kids will get introduced to an interest. We see our role as a way to hone these skills and get them to latch on it and run.”

These classes are done through the same online classroom environment that iQ Academy uses.

There are screen sharing capabilities and ways Thorstad can demonstrate using programs to the students. A benefit of the class being part of IQ Academy’s structure is that students can revisit material easily since it’s all digital and all of their sessions are recorded.

“We record all of our sessions so if kids want to review material or missed something they can catch up,” he said.

Thorstad has also included guest speakers that the students might suggest. Recently, he had the dad of a student in on one of the sessions showing how to use a 3D printer.

“There are a lot of possibilities for sure,” Thorstad said.

Hunter Lynk is one ninth-grade student in the group who signed up because he liked how the class is interactive and involves independent study but also can be collaborative.

“I’m really into a lot of computer-based things and this sparked my interest,” Lynk said.

Lynk’s favorite units have been photo editing using a program called pixlr and video game creation.

“We go through the basics, but it also goes pretty in-depth as well,” Lynk said.

Lynk lives in Glenwood and has been attending IQ Academy for about a year and half. Lynk noted that he liked the variety of courses available through the K-12 school and the opportunities there.
