Again.

We have said it before and we will say it again … JavaScript is eating the world. An established favorite in the developer community, the programming language has become the one to beat.

Developer research company RedMonk’s bi-annual rankings table merely confirms this.

JavaScript sat at the top of the tree when RedMonk last released its rankings in September 2015 and it sits there today. The default programming language of the Web has been a long-time presence in the table and looks unlikely to relinquish its ranking any time soon.

If anyone needed further proof that the programming language is crushing the competition, then a straw poll of attendees at DeveloperWeek in San Francisco would have given the required answers. Almost every panel praised JavaScript, so much so that fans of other programming language were hard to find.

“JavaScript has had an incredible run,” said Meteor CEO Geoff Schmidt in his talk on the democratization of app development. “When you think about the languages that have had an outcome like JavaScript … it started out in the 90s as a way to make things blink on a webpage and here we are at a conference dedicated to it.”
