Imperative languages[edit]
Imperative programming languages may be multi-paradigm and appear in other classifications. Here is a list of programming languages that follow the imperative paradigm:

Ada
ALGOL
BASIC
Blue
C
C++
C#
Ceylon
COBOL
D
eC
FORTRAN
GAUSS
Go
Groovy
Java
Julia
Lua
MATLAB
Machine language
Modula-2, Modula-3
MUMPS
Nim
Oberon
Object Pascal
OCaml
Pascal
Perl
PHP
PROSE
Python
Ruby
Rust
Wolfram Language
Interactive mode languages[edit]
Interactive mode languages act as a kind of shell: expressions or statements can be entered one at a time, and the result of their evaluation is seen immediately. The interactive mode is also known as a REPL (read–eval–print loop).

APL
BASIC (some dialects)
Clojure
Common Lisp
Dart (with Observatory or Dartium's developer tools)
Erlang
F#
Forth
FPr
Fril
GAUSS
Groovy
Haskell (with the GHCi or Hugs interpreter)
IDL
J
JavaScript (using command line tools like Node.js or Rhino or the developer tools built into web browsers like Firefox or Chrome)
Julia
Lua
MUMPS (an ANSI standard general purpose language)
Maple
Mathematica (Wolfram language)
MATLAB
ML
Perl
Pike
PostScript
Python
PROSE
R
REXX
Ruby (with IRB)
Scala
Scheme
Smalltalk (anywhere in a Smalltalk environment)
S-Lang (with the S-Lang shell, slsh)
Tcl (with the Tcl shell, tclsh)
Windows PowerShell (Microsoft .NET-based CLI)
Visual FoxPro (Microsoft)
Interpreted languages[edit]
Interpreted languages are programming languages in which programs may be executed from source code form, by an interpreter. Theoretically, any language can be compiled or interpreted, so the term *interpreted language* generally refers to languages that are commonly interpreted rather than compiled.

Ant
APL
AutoHotkey scripting language
AutoIt scripting language
BASIC (some dialects)
DATABUS (later versions added optional compiling)
DM
Eiffel (via "Melting Ice Technology" in EiffelStudio)
Forth (interactive shell only; otherwise compiled to native or threaded code)
FPr (Virtual machine: Text is compiled to linked lists; linked lists are interpreted)
Game Maker Language
Groovy
Haskell (GHCi, Hugs, NHC, YHC etc.)
J
Julia (Compiled on the fly to machine code, but a transpiler Julia2C is also available.)
JavaScript
Lisp (Early versions, pre-1962, and some experimental ones; production Lisp systems are compilers, but many of them still provide an interpreter if needed.)
Tea
LPC
Lua
MUMPS (an ANSI standard general purpose language)
Maple
Mathematica
MATLAB
Oriel
Pascal (early implementations)
PCASTL
Perl
PHP
Pikt
PostScript
PROSE
Python
REXX
R
Ruby
S-Lang
Standard ML (SML)
Spin
Tcl
TI-BASIC
TorqueScript
thinBasic scripting language
VBScript
Windows PowerShell (Microsoft .NET-based CLI)
Wolfram Language
