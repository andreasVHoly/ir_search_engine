The Future of Creativity Depends on Kids Who Can Program

The future of creativity may depend on younger generations being taught computer coding skills just as they are taught foreign languages, mathematics, and science. As we integrate digital products deeper and deeper into our lives, from smartphones to cars which are largely run by computers, dreaming up new ideas will depend on our ability to use coding languages.

Megan Smith, Chief Technology Officer of the United States and former Google executive, has already called on educators to teach every American child how to code. But classroom teachers face a steep learning curve themselves as most were born during a time without advanced coding languages. Still, hardware and software manufacturers are attempting to reach younger generations with accessible technology. 

The UK may be the most proactive at promoting programming to its young. The country's revolutionary Raspberry Pi, a credit-card sized computer selling for about $50, introduces students to basic programming. And England is set to become the first country to require programming curriculum in their schools, starting from age 5 and going through age 16.

In the US, Code.org has used its celebrity power, recruiting everyone from Shakira to President Obama to Ashton Kutcher, to promote its Hour of Code, an initiative which encourages students to learn computer programming skills.

So where should you get started? Larry Wall, founder of the Perl programming language, explains which five computer programming languages are most essential to know:
