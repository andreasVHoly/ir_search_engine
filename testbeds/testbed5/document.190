Parents tired of presenting their kids with bikini-clad Barbies and heavily made-up Bratz dolls cheered when GoldieBlox came on the market. The company's debut doll, a spunky figure clad in overalls and sneakers, taught kids basic tech and engineering principles. But there was one problem: White, blond Goldie was the only doll it offered.

Three years after the GoldieBlox Kickstarter turned the action figure company into a bona fide hit, it has released its second hero: Ruby Rails, an African American action figure who has a computer in her backpack so she can write code wherever she goes.

“It’s really important to me to show diversity in the GoldieBlox characters because I want every kid to be able to look at GoldieBlox and see themselves,” Debbie Sterling, creator of GoldieBlox, told Time.

The primary criticism directed at the company was of its lack of options. Although Goldie was accompanied by Ruby and another pal, Valentina Voltz, in advertising videos, Goldie was the only figure sold, and her bright blond hair made her reminiscent of the classic Barbie doll.

After two years of creating an African American doll, the figure is ready to be purchased in time for the holiday season. Named after the programming language Ruby on Rails, the doll has movable joints and hands that can grip, and kids can build her transportation device. Using basic engineering principles, kids can send Ruby soaring through the air in a working fabric parachute. Sterling hopes both dolls will pique girls’ interest in science and math fields, careers in which women are an underrepresented minority.

To announce the doll’s availability for purchase, GoldieBlox released an ad that depicts Ruby and Goldie as heroes in action films like Jurassic World, Mission Impossible, and Rocky. Statistics about women’s lack of starring roles in mainstream films are interspersed with images of Ruby piloting a fighter plane, Top Gun style, and preparing for battle as a gladiator.

“The most iconic action heroes are almost always men,” Sterling told Time. “Boys grow up with superheroes, and girls grow up with damsels in distress who are saved by those superheroes. Those stereotypes become how kids identify with their own gender.”

The team at GoldieBlox isn’t looking to finance the next woman-helmed action flick but instead provide girls with positive role models and show them they can be engineers, action heroes, or whatever else they choose.
