Concurrent languages[edit]
See also: List of concurrent and parallel programming languages and Category:Concurrent programming languages
Message passing languages provide language constructs for concurrency. The predominant paradigm for concurrency in mainstream languages such as Java is shared memory concurrency based on monitors. Concurrent languages that make use of message passing have generally been inspired by CSP or the p-calculus, but have had little commercial success, except for Ada and Erlang. Ada is a multipurpose language and concurrent programming is only one option available.

Ada (multi-purpose language)
Alef – concurrent language with threads and message passing, used for systems programming in early versions of Plan 9 from Bell Labs
Ateji PX an extension of the Java language for parallelism
ChucK – domain specific programming language for audio, precise control over concurrency and timing
Cilk – a concurrent C
C? – C Omega, a research language extending C#, uses asynchronous communication
Clojure – a dialect of Lisp for the Java virtual machine
Chapel
Co-array Fortran
Concurrent Pascal (by Brinch-Hansen)
Curry
E – uses promises, ensures deadlocks cannot occur
Eiffel (through the SCOOP mechanism, Simple Concurrent Object-Oriented Computation)
Erlang – uses asynchronous message passing with nothing shared
Go
Java
Join Java – concurrent language based on Java
X10
Julia
Join-calculus
Joule – dataflow language, communicates by message passing
Limbo – relative of Alef, used for systems programming in Inferno (operating system)
MultiLisp – Scheme variant extended to support parallelism
occam – influenced heavily by Communicating Sequential Processes (CSP)
occam-p – a modern variant of occam, which incorporates ideas from Milner's p-calculus
Orc
Oz – multiparadigm language, supports shared-state and message-passing concurrency, and futures, and Mozart Programming System cross-platform Oz
Pict – essentially an executable implementation of Milner's p-calculus
Rust – actor-based
SALSA – actor language with token-passing, join, and first-class continuations for distributed computing over the Internet
Scala – implements Erlang-style actors on the JVM
SequenceL – purely functional, automatically parallelizing and race-free
SR – research language
Unified Parallel C
XProc – XML processing language, enabling concurrency
