JavaScript is the most important language in programming by most measures. Approximately 93% of websites use it in some capacity, according to certain web surveys.

So for those who want to make a career of coding, a working knowledge of JavaScript is essential, and programmers comfortable with the language are among the most well-compensated in the industry.

If you are looking to sharpen your JavaScript skills, StackSocial is offering a set of classes that could be of great service to you. The Complete JavaScript Coding Bundle consists of eight courses, covering everything from the basics of JavaScript to its associated frameworks, which will make your coding more efficient once you’ve mastered the fundamentals.

To start, students will establish a foundational knowledge of JavaScript with beginner courses designed for those who have never coded before. You’ll learn the syntax of JavaScript, and how the language can interact with HTML and CSS to build dynamic web pages. After that, you’ll learn to work with frameworks, such as EmberJS, AngularJS, and jQuery — these are tools that allow you to build your projects faster and cleaner.

If you were to purchase these courses separately they would cost you upwards of $1,000 total, but through the current deal available at StackSocial you can get access to all eight classes for just $59. It’s a great investment for anyone just starting out in their coding career.
