Data-oriented languages[edit]
Data-oriented languages provide powerful ways of searching and manipulating the relations that have been described as entity relationship tables which map one set of things into other sets. Examples of data-oriented languages include:

Clarion
Clipper
dBase a relational database access language
MUMPS (an ANSI standard general purpose language with specializations for database work)
Caché (similar to MUMPS)
RDQL
SPARQL
SQL
Tutorial D – see also The Third Manifesto
Visual FoxPro – a native RDBMS engine, object-oriented, RAD
WebDNA
WebQL
Wolfram Language
Data-structured languages[edit]
See also: Category:Data-structured programming languages
Data-structured languages are those where logic is structured in ways similar to their data. Such languages are generally well suited to reflection and introspection. There are three main types:

Array-based
List-based
Stack-based
Assembly languages that statically link data inline with instructions can also be considered data-structured, in the most primitive way.

Decision table languages[edit]
Decision tables can be used as an aid to clarifying the logic before writing a program in any language, but in the 1960s a number of languages were developed where the main logic is expressed directly in the form of a decision table, including:

Filetab
Declarative languages[edit]
See also: Category:Declarative programming languages
Declarative languages describe a problem rather than defining a solution. Declarative programming stands in contrast to imperative programming via imperative programming languages, where serial orders (imperatives) are given to a computer. In addition to the examples given just below, all (pure) functional and logic-based programming languages are also declarative. In fact, "functional" and "logical" constitute the usual subcategories of the declarative category.

Analytica
Ant (partially declarative languages, partially imperative programming)
DASL (partially declarative languages, partially imperative programming)
Lustre
Mercury
MetaPost
Modelica
Prolog
Oz
RDQL
SequenceL – purely functional, automatically parallelizing and race-free
SPARQL
SQL
Wolfram Language
xBase
XSL Transformations
