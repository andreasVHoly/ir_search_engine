The Top Programming Languages, Ranked by Job Demand, Popularity, More

If you're interested in learning to code, for fun or financial gain, this interactive chart from IEEE Spectrum can help you pick the first (or next) language to learn.
Which Programming Language Should I Learn First?

Dear Lifehacker, With all the buzz about learning to code, I've decided to give it a try. Theâ€¦

It ranks dozens of programming languages against 12 weighted data sources: Google search, Google trends, Github, Stack Overflow, Hacker News, Reddit, Career Builder, Dice, Topsy, and IEEE Xplore. In addition to the overall rank, you can view which languages are rapidly growing, are in high demand in the workplace, popular in social sites and open source hubs (e.g., GitHub and Stack Overflow), or your own custom weighting. You can also filter by language type: web, mobile, enterprise, or embedded.

Interestingly enough, Java tops the list for all of the rankings. To account for the weighting to be skewed by people needing help with the languages rather than actual popularity, IEEE Spectrum separated some sources to differentiate between queries that were asking questions versus resources for current coders. See more of their methodology here.

Of course, there's much more to consider when choosing a language than just popularity (for first-time coders, Lifehacker readers voted for Python), but this is an interesting look at the current state of programming languages.
