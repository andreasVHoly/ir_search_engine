There's an Arnold Schwarzenegger Programming Language

If coding bores you, maybe you just need to try a different programming language. Perhaps you'll allow us to recommend one but together by Lauri Hartikka—which is themed around Arnold Schwarzenegger.

Called ArnoldC—see what he did there?—it's "an imperative programming language where the basic keywords are replaced with quotes from different Schwarzenegger movies." Yes, really.

So, every program has to start ("IT'S SHOWTIME") and stop ("YOU HAVE BEEN TERMINATED"). To print text you use the command "TALK TO THE HAND"; to declare a variable you type "HEY CHRISTMAS TREE "; while is "STICK AROUND"; return is, obviously, "I'LL BE BACK". And so on, and so on, hilariously.

If you're interested—and of course you are—a full program to print all the numbers from 1 to 10 would look something like this:

    IT'S SHOWTIME

    HEY CHRISTMAS TREE isLessThan10

    YOU SET US UP @NO PROBLEMO

    HEY CHRISTMAS TREE n

    YOU SET US UP 0

    STICK AROUND isLessThan10

    GET TO THE CHOPPER n

    HERE IS MY INVITATION n

    GET UP 1

    ENOUGH TALK

    TALK TO THE HAND n

    GET TO THE CHOPPER isLessThan10

    HERE IS MY INVITATION 10

    LET OFF SOME STEAM BENNET n

    ENOUGH TALK

    CHILL

    YOU HAVE BEEN TERMINATED
