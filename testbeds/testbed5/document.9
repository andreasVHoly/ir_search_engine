Top Programming Languages To Future-Proof Your Portfolio

With several programming languages available in the market, it is very important to choose the ones that can help you plan your future or plan your development teams. There are constant lists about programming languages that come out every year.

TIOBE, a Netherlands-based company is one such company that keeps a regular list of the most commonly used languages and assesses code for quality. The company’s list not only shows the relative popular languages that it is testing currently, but also a good picture of the development market as it exists right now.

Another way to figure out which programming languages are currently hot in the market is looking at the companies graph for hiring programmers, which in turn gives us a peek into the future.

Toptal is a company that acts as a broker between developers and the companies that want to hire them. It has a list of the most popular languages used in hiring searches — a list that doesn’t directly track to the TIOBE list.

Alvaro Oliveira, VP of talent operations for Toptal said according to their list that the No. 1 language that the companies are searching for is Swift. “Swift is new, so it’s expected for its growth to be way higher than any other languages,” Oliveira said. “It’s also the language that has allowed a lot of people to join the iOS market.”

According to Oliveira, Swift’s growth is coming from two sources: Those moving their programming from Objective C, and those coming into the iOS development market for the first time. “The iOS programming market was always held back by Objective C, which is a language that a lot of people found uninviting,” he said. “But then Swift came along and was much easier.”

The other language at the top of Toptal’s chart is HTML. “For any web project, HTML is going to be there. Whether it’s a Ruby on Rails or Rython job, HTML will be there. It shows that Web pages are still in demand,” Oliveira said.

Let’s have a look at the languages most commonly used in March 2016.
