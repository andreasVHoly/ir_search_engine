Legacy languages prove lucrative for dying breed of programmers 

ORGANISATIONS will be forced to spend billions of dollars extra in application modernisation programs if systems written in old programming languages are not retired soon.

As major financial institutions go through their modernisation programs, the battle for skills has intensified.

Corporate Australia and government agencies are big users of Cobol on mainframes, for example, and owners of this particular skill set are part of a dying breed (see table below).

Others on the extinction list include Delphi, PowerBuilder and Fortran, a programming language created in the 1950s.

In fact, it was only two years ago that Qantas Loyalty ditched its Fortran-based loyalty management system for Oracle Siebel. Qantas had been using the system, called Profile, for more than 22 years.

People with skills in decades-old languages are fast becoming scarce. There's also a disparity between pay packets for programmers in different locations.

According to Peoplebank statistics, a full-time Java/J2EE developer can earn up to $90,000 a year in Perth.

The same person, based in Sydney, would earn up to $110,000 in their annual pay packet.

Peoplebank chief executive Peter Acheson said the shortage of Cobol programmers was fundamentally because it was an old skill set and not attractive to the younger generation. "If you're 19, you won't want to go and study Cobol, so there will continue to be a shortage in Cobol," Mr Acheson said.

"In the past 12 months, there have been many mainframe migration projects, and retired Cobol developers have had to be lured back into the workforce."

He said the range for a Cobol programmer varied from $500 to $700 daily, depending on the experience and location of the candidate.

Something similar would apply to Fortran, Delphi and PowerBuilder developers.

According to Micro Focus Australia country manager Bruce Craig, all the big four banks in Australia used Cobol.

Of the tier-two banks, about 70 per cent used Cobol, he said.

Similarly, in the insurance sector, 100 per cent of tier-one companies used Cobol, and about 50 per cent of tier-two companies relied on it, Mr Craig said. In the federal government space, about 60-70 per cent of large agencies used Cobol.

He has a vested interest in pushing application modernisation programs, as that is a specialty of Micro Focus.

The shortage of these skills is so acute that government agencies in Canberra constantly have to stave off competition from banks and insurers also in the same upgrade pool.

One company that was contemplating a modernisation program baulked when it was quoted $1500 a day to hire a Delphi on DB2 programmer.

Kevin Francis, national practices manager at Sydney-based software developer Object Consulting, said such tales were not surprising.

Mr Francis said there was no doubt that developers on old, rare technologies were able to charge ridiculous rates for their time.

"I have seen examples of developers on older technologies like RPG and Delphi charging twice the rate of a developer on a newer technology," he said.

Languages with more than five years of shelf life were Ruby, .NET 4.0, Java SE 6, Haskell, JavaScript, Perl, PHP, Python, Objective C and Groovy, Mr Francis said.

He said organisations should conduct an urgent review, move away from old environments, or risk bigger problems if they rested on their laurels.

Applications written in languages that should be retired immediately include Java 1.1, J2SE 1.3, RPG, Smalltalk, Pascal and FoxPro.

Those that have a three-year shelf life include .NET 2.0, J2SE 1.4 and Cold Fusion.

"Enterprise architects need to be vigilant and move away from certain languages before they

become unsupported. The longer you wait the more costly the exercise will be," Mr Francis said.

Migrating from the mainframe was not impossible, but it was a step-by-step process.

"You could get off the mainframe, you could have Cobol on Windows, but that only solves half the problem. So the trick is to go the whole way and migrate from Cobol to C# (pronounced C sharp)," he said.

Mr Acheson had a blunt warning -- there is no replenishment of skills coming through the ranks for Cobol, Delphi and most of the older programming languages.

Specialists in these areas would not be around forever, and when they were gone, organisations would have to pay even more to use such skills.
