Top Ten Programmers of All Time

Programming is not easy. And it never was. But it is much easier to do simple computing tasks by using a programming language of your choice than it was about years ago. And the scenario was even worse before that time. But there were some programmers and computer enthusiasts who worked hard to provide the world better options in programming and to set a trend of continuous improvements in whatever was invented.

The evolution from Machine code to Assembly language to procedural languages like C to Object Oriented Languages like Java and other various types of programming languages(like scripting languages e.g. Javascript, Perl etc) is the result of that trend.

The list varies from great programmers of past to the ones which are still busy in ensuring a brighter future for computers.
1.Dennis Ritchie

Dennis Ritchie created the C programming language, which is one of the best programming languages. He also created the Unix Operating System along with his colleague Ken Thompson.
The C programming language revolutionized the Computer Field and led the foundation for the development of Programming languages more efficient than their predecessors.
While Unix made the base for The Linux Operating System which is widely used today.

2.Tim Beners-Lee

Sir Tim Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist and one of the greatest programmers. He had written the 3 fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of today’s Web (and which you may have seen appear on parts of your Web browser): i.e. HTML, URL, HTTP.

Tim also wrote the first Web page editor/browser (“WorldWideWeb.app”) and the first Web server (“httpd“). By the end of 1990, the first Web page was invented on the open internet, and in 1991, people outside of CERN were invited to join this new Web community.

3. Linus Torvalds

The man who created Linux Kernel. Linux operating system is a clone to the Unix operating system, written originally by Linus Torvalds and a loosely knit team of programmers all around the world.

4.James Gosling

James Gosling created Java, which is one of the most widely used Object Oriented programming languages used today. He created the main frame for Java and implemented the language’s original compiler and virtual machine.
He is also one of the most under-advertized programmers with only a few people know about him.

5. Richard Stallman

He founded the Free Software Foundation, developed the GNU Compiler Collection(GCC). Richard Stallman is the prophet of the free software movement. He understood the dangers of software patents years ago. Now that this has become a crucial issue in the world. He has hugely successful efforts to establish the idea of “Free Software”.
