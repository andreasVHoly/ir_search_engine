Talent shortages throughout the IT sector continued in March, with JavaScript developers most in demand. Pharma and medtech sectors are driving demand for engineers.

Multilingual roles continued to flood the jobs market last month, with the regular talent shortages in IT persisting, according to Morgan McKinley.

The recruiter’s latest look at the jobs market found that an almost 20pc drop in people looking for work – in comparison with March 2015 – isn’t helping things.

A shortage of JavaScript developers is most prevalent, while the pharmaceutical, food and medical devices sectors continue to drive demand for engineering, procurement and production professionals.

Morgan McKinley’s COO Keren O’Flaherty said the shortage of engineering talent in 2015 has reduced due to the return of professionals mainly from Australia and Canada.

“The IT sector continues to be a highly competitive and aggressive jobs market, with talent shortages driving salary inflation,” she said.

“If these shortages continue, the ability to attract inward investment at 2015 levels will be impacted.”
