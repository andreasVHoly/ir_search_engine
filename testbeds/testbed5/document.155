Interactive: The Top Programming Languages 2015
New languages enter the scene, and big data makes its mark
By Nick Diakopoulos & Stephen Cass
Posted 20 Jul 2015 | 15:06 GMT
This app ranks the popularity of dozens of programming languages. You can filter them by listing only those most relevant to particular sectors, such as "Web" or "embedded programming." Rankings are created by weighting and combining 12 metrics from 10 sources. We offer preset weightings—the default is our IEEE Spectrum ranking—but there are presets for those interested in what's trending or most looked for by employers. Don't like the defaults? Take complete control and create your own ranking by adjusting each metric's weighting yourself. To compare with last year's data, add a comparison and then choose "edit ranking," which will give you the option to take data from 2014.

We take a similarly pragmatic approach to how we classify languages into types like "embedded" or "Web." Placement is based on typical use: For example, we are very impressed by those brave souls who have written Web servers completely in assembly code, but we're not going to categorize Assembly as a Web development language.
