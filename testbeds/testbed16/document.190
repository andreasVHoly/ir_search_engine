What’s the Difference between Elasticity and Scalability in Cloud Computing

What’s the Difference between Elasticity and Scalability in Cloud ComputingOften used interchangeably, scalability and elasticity are not quite the same when looking at cloud computing. Both refer to an environment’s adaptability – to be able to expand and contract as required. As workload volumes increase this requires allocating and adding resources, and detaching or reallocating resources as the demand goes down.
Cloud computing is also perceived in many different ways, but generally comprises self-service, resource pooling and delivery of on-demand computing resources, requiring both scalability and elasticity.

Elasticity in cloud infrastructure involves enabling the hypervisor to create virtual machines or containers with the resources to meet the real-time demand. Scalability often is discussed at the application layer, highlighting capability of a system, network or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged in order to accommodate that growth.
While scalability can rely on elasticity, it can also be achieved with over provisioning.
There are two types of scalability:
The first option is Scale Vertically or Scale-Up – this type of scalability can work with any application to a limited degree. In an elastic environment, scaling up would be accomplished by moving the application to a bigger virtual machine or by resizing the VM.
The second option is Scale Horizontally or Scale-out, by provisioning more instances of the application tiers on additional virtual machines and then dividing the load between them.
Horizontal scaling is similar to elasticity; it allows the redivision of resources between applications by provisioning, or by claiming back virtual machines. Horizontal scaling uses the infrastructure elasticity, but the application needs to be able to scale by adding more nodes and by distributing the load.
For applications with uneven usage, or spikes during periods, having built in elasticity and scalability is crucial. Applications should be designed to detect variations in the real-time demand for resources, such as bandwidth, storage and compute power. However, most legacy applications have been developed to run on a single machine and require recoding to adapt for both the scalability and elasticity that the cloud provides.
The question for business units and IT then becomes where to host the application – on a private or public cloud. Workload demand is one of the considerations, in addition to data sensitivity, costs and others. Generally, sporadic workloads are better off on the public cloud, or on a private cloud that can utilize bursting. Workloads with steady usage often benefit from being hosted on the private cloud, from both a cost and performance perspective.
