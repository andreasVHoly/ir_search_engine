When many think of SAP SAP +%, the first thing that comes to mind is an extremely large, profitable, yet expensive, software company. And, for the most part, they would be right. But a growing group of up-starts are attempting to disrupt SAP’s business model by offering faster, cheaper and more flexible options. Recently SAP has taken notice and implemented an audacious new cloud strategy to fight back. It’s a part of a new strategy that if successful, will fundamentally change not only how SAP sells enterprise software, but moreover, how the rest of industry buys and consumes it.

To understand SAP is to understand a giant in the enterprise software space. According to Forbes Global 2000 ranking of the largest software companies, SAP comes in at #3 with a combined market value of $103.9 billion. Only Microsoft MSFT -1.68% and Oracle ORCL +% are bigger. To put the company in perspective, in fourth place is Symantec SYMC -0.70%, with a market value of roughly $17 billion.  SAP isn’t just big; it’s bigger than most other software companies combined. Changing its course is much like turning a container ship. Something a growing group of its competitors have been using to their advantage.

This week the company announced a bold new plan to re-invent itself as a cloud computing company. A major part of the company’s cloud plan is to provide its products over the Internet using a subscription-based approach, rather than the per server, per user license model it has used in the past.

A major part of its new focus is on its HANA product line, which uses advanced in-memory database technology in place of more traditional approaches for the management of large data sets, sometimes referred to as “Big Data.”  Big Data is quickly becoming a very big deal in the enterprise space with a broad group of companies looking to stake a claim.

The stakes are very high and SAP hopes that by providing a suite of cloud based big data products and services, it will remove one of its biggest obstacles – the complexity and cost of deploying its software. Cost has been a reoccurring problem with large-scale SAP deployments.  This has been a big reason why the company’s up-take outside of the largest enterprises has been limited. Yet even with this cost and complexity hurdle, SAP managed to generate more than $20 billion in sales last year.

An article in The Register, points out the challenge SAP and other enterprise vendors face,  “After more than 20 years coining it, the Goliaths of the lucrative enterprise software world are about to meet their Davids: nimble rivals touting technology at a sensible price.”

It is true that both SAP and its primary rival Oracle make a lot of money. Oracle’s revenue for last year was a $37 billion, up 4 per cent year on year. But don’t let these numbers fool you, as The Register points out “these healthy figures mask a looming danger for Oracle and SAP: their revenue growth is slowing, especially since the global economy tanked in 2008 and everyone’s belts tightened. As cash-strapped customers demand cheaper cloud-based products – which are powered by servers the customers do not have to directly maintain – Oracle and SAP’s complex software licenses and hefty support contracts suddenly look unappetizing.”

The SAP executive team seem to understand the new realities facing an evolving software market and have taken what can best be described as an “all in” approach to cloud computing to help it retain its position. In an attempt to fend off a growing group of challengers, SAP has been investing heavily in acquiring cloud companies including recently Ariba and SuccessFactors, as well as building out a global cloud infrastructure, which it plans to offer its enterprise customers.

In an article in the New York Times, a company official said,  “SAP has established a network of seven data centers around the globe to support the endeavor, and will begin by deploying 30,000 computers for the network. We will do cloud-based ERP on a massive scale,” said Vishal Sikka, a member of SAP’s executive board and one of the people who oversaw the cloud project. Of SAP’s regular product, he said, “At some point in the future, complex implementations should go away. All of our products are moving to HANA.”

Yet in order for SAP to be successful as a cloud company, it will need look beyond its size and scale but embrace its eco-system of system integrators and service providers. One such company is Bethesda based Virtustream who along with its customer, Florida Crystals Corporation, recently announced the first production deployment of a SAP ECC HANA System. “The performance of our production version ECC on the HANA Managed Service is astounding,” said Don Whittington, CIO of Florida Crystals Corporation. “Reports that ran in minutes are running in milliseconds. Programs that previously ran for hours are now finishing in a matter of minutes. This, combined with the cost effectiveness of the pay-what-you-use cloud environment and white glove service of a fully managed SAP environment, we now plan to move to HANA for all of our production environments in the Virtustream enterprise cloud.”

Mr. Sikka said SAP served some 220 utilities globally, who reach about 2.5 billion customers. The utilities could let the customers use HANA to model how much they were spending, and finding ways to cut their bills. “We realized we could do that for them with 2,000 servers,” he said.

SAP is certainly not alone in the transition to cloud computing. Earlier this week Adobe Systems ADBE -1.33% announced that its popular Creative Suite, which bundles Photoshop, Illustrator and a number of its other products, will be available only by subscription through Adobe’s cloud service, aptly titled, Creative Cloud. Although not exactly a cloud service yet, at least from the sense that software runs remotely. It is the company’s first steps into the cloud as part of a broader plan to move its entire product line into a cloud based future. As part of the initiative, all future versions of its software will be delivered over the web, no boxes and disks required, something that is quickly becoming a requirement of many traditional software vendors from Microsoft to IBM. It seems that the age of boxed, licenses software is over.

The growing trend toward cloud computing appears to have put many of the more established software vendors on the defensive. A big part of the problem comes down to the way software is traditionally licensed, on a per user or per server basis. This simply doesn’t work in a cloud world where there are no longer specific desktops or servers and the line between yours and mine blurs and software as a discreet component is longer important. It’s becoming very clear that a service or Software as a Service is the only thing that matters. In order to manage this transition, the largest software players are rapidly trying to figure out how to adapt to this changing landscape. Increasingly the answer is a hosted pay-per-use model.

In a post on wired, Vincent Brasseur points out the enterprise licensing challenges by writing, “Driven by vendors such as Amazon, software license models in the cloud are often pay-as-you-go and/or subscription-based licenses. The best-known example is Salesforce.com, which is licensed according to the number of users on a subscription basis. This model works well for a full integrated service, or when replacing an existing (on-premises) software solution. It does not really work when you move an existing system to the cloud, if the organization would not be able to use their existing licenses anymore. As the number of cloud service providers has expanded, major ISVs (independent software vendors) have created new licensing models or adjusted existing ones to provide additional flexibility.“

When SAP’s Vishal Sikka was asked about Salesforce, he commented, “We have single customers running projects that are bigger than the entire Salesforce.com cloud,” Although size isn’t necessarily a guarantee of success in the cloud world, SAP hopes that its scale might be and with 30,000 servers to start, it certainly gives them a nice starting point.

At the end of the day, SAP and other enterprise focused software companies are in the midst of a reinvention.  With the enemy at the gates, it will without question be an interesting transition to watch.
