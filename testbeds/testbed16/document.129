Scalability in Platform Architecture

“Scalability” refers to the number of users, sessions, transactions, and operations that can be accommodated by the entire system. Simply put, scalability is about doing what you do in a bigger way: Scaling a Web application means allowing more people to use the application by growing it to meet growing demand, without changing the code or sacrificing the data affinity and service levels your users demand. Why is scalability important? Because, in the end, you ideally want to build an application that can serve millions of users with zero downtime. Several organizations build a jumble of applications that don’t conform to set standards and don’t share a cohesive deployment pattern. This reduces their ability to iterate on product development and thereby creates a lag in business. Adopting a scalable platform architecture that covers all applications is a way to solve this problem.

WHAT ARE THE KEYS TO A SCALABLE ARCHITECTURE?

Developing a flexible, scalable architecture for an application or service can be a significant challenge. It’s hard to identify the stress points in your application until you’ve actually seen it fail, at least once. However, more and more businesses are building applications that require high-load tolerance and greater up-time. In addition, organizations want to be able to grow their user base with a minimum of effort, which puts more load on applications and forces them to cope with ever-increasing demand.

For such applications, a solid and scalable platform architecture is essential. Every aspect of the application’s design requires consideration, including the consideration of ways in which the runtime of hard-hit areas can be reduced, or of the ways in which caching can be made just a bit smaller to ease the memory footprint. From this perspective, developing a scalable platform architecture is really more of an art than a science, so smart organizations often turn to vendors who can provide and manage a scalable architecture that meets their needs.

A scalable platform enables organizations to solve large-scale business problems through the high-performance processing of massive data volumes. By incorporating an SOA architecture that all applications can inherit, you can ensure that all of your applications have an efficiently scalable architecture and can be easily managed and upgraded. Several high-quality providers, such as Apprenda, provide an “out of the box” scalable architecture that does just that.
