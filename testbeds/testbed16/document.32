No doubt that you have heard the buzz about cloud computing. If you have been tuned into this blog or other similar blogs you have no doubt also heard the talk of saving money, saving time, and increased agility using patterns of expertise. There are substantial benefits to be gained and increased efficiency when using cloud computing and especially when using patterns of expertise in the cloud. Perhaps all of this talk has piqued your interest but then you get back to you day job, look at the applications your company uses, and have no idea where to begin.
Well, there is help available in a great series of articles to help you analyze, evaluate and move forward with onboarding your applications into a private cloud solution. This particular series of articles was written specifically for onboarding your applications into IBM PureApplication System. However, if you have been following things then you also know that the core pattern technology included in PureApplication System and other IBM offerings such as IBM SmartCloud Application Workload Services got their start right here with Workload Deployer. That means that these articles are directly applicable for IBM Workload Deployer if you choose this solution where you build your own private cloud. One caveat to keep in mind - the function that is discussed in some of the articles around AMC (Advanced Middleware Configuration) that is included in PureApplication System is not included in Workload Deployer.  However this same function is provided in Rational Automation Framework and when combined with IBM Workload Deployer you have the same capabilities.  
So now is the time to take the next step! Check out the onboarding articles and see just how easy it can be to move your current applications into the cloud. If you don't already have IBM Workload Deployer you can also take advantage of these free trial offers to get first-hand experience with just how easy it is to work with patterns. In no time at all you will be able to reap the benefits of cloud computing and patterns of expertise for your business.
