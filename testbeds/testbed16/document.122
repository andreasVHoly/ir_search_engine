PaaS Model / Systems

Platform as a Service (PaaS) is software that connects people or software components with applications. With the infrastructure of code provided by the PaaS model, applications can be developed and deployed at a lower cost because the need to buy and manage the underlying software and hardware has been eliminated.

The PaaS model offers a wide range of application services to facilitate team collaboration and coordination, web service and database integration, state management, and application instrumentation”?all while providing storage, security, and scalability. Cloud platform services allow for the development, testing, deployment, hosting, and maintenance of applications within the same integrated development environment. Different combinations of services can be configured to support the life cycle of application development. Unlike SaaS, the PaaS model offered by providers such as Apprenda can be successfully used even by developers who are “operations blind.”

KEY FEATURES OF THE PAAS SYSTEM

TOOLS FOR WEB-BASED USER INTERFACE CREATION

The PaaS system allows developers to define rich and interactive multi-user environments and scenarios that can be tested by real people, with tools that make it easy to identify problematic features. Different interfaces can be defined to suit different user profiles. User experience is greatly improved with the PaaS model because it can incorporate channels for user feedback throughout all the phases of design, development, testing, production, and evolution of a given application.

FLEXIBLE MULTI-TENANT ARCHITECTURE

The PaaS model typically supports the shared use of applications by many users while providing scalability, concurrency management, and security. User profiles, access, navigation history, interaction history, and application usage can all be tracked and defined.

ENHANCED DEVELOPMENT-TEAM COLLABORATION

PaaS allows for greatly enhanced productivity because it offers users the ability to form and share code with ad-hoc, pre-defined, or distributed teams. The PaaS system allows schedules, objectives, teams, and the different responsibilities and roles of users and owners to be defined, updated, and tracked based on access rights.

TARGETED UTILITY INSTRUMENTATION

With the PaaS model, developers have more insight into the behavior of users and the workings of applications. They can easily determine whether services are valuable to customers and track the usage patterns of different services or user interactions.
