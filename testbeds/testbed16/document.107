Multi-Cloud Security Demands Unified Cloud Data Security

Unified Cloud Data SecurityThink fast! How many of your organization’s critical operations now live in the cloud? Do you use any of the following:

Cloud CRM
Cloud file sync and share
Cloud communications and collaboration
Cloud email
Cloud storage
Cloud business analytics
Cloud accounting
Cloud HRMS
On top of that, does your organization use any other third-party cloud enterprise applications? The selection is vast and encompasses even security solutions, such as cloud-based network and wireless access control and cloud-based identity and access management.

Now that you’ve come up with a rough idea of how many cloud applications are in use at your business, think about how you’re securing your organization’s sensitive or legally protected data in those clouds. Do you make use of encryption, tokenization, DLP, and policy-based user access limitations?

It’s beginning to look like a tangled web, isn’t it?

Next, consider the monitoring and auditing capabilities you have for your individual cloud applications and the security measures you’ve implemented for each of them. Do your security administrators have deep and granular visibility into data access and user activities in each application? Are there mechanisms in place to detect and automatically alert admins of anomalous or suspicious requests to the cloud servers? And are robust reporting tools available for the security solutions you’ve implemented for each cloud application to ease forensics and compliance tasks?

Finally, ask yourself (or your information security team) whether every single one of your cloud applications is equally secured and monitored in compliance with internal policies, industry standards, and legal requirements?

By now, the incredible complexities of protecting and securing a multi-cloud enterprise should be clear. Gone are the days when an organization might use just one cloud application, if it adopted the cloud at all. These days, it’s more common to see enterprises adopting Salesforce, ServiceNow, Box,—among thousands of other cloud options—in tandem, and needing to secure their sensitive data in every one of those cloud applications and services.

Need for a Unified Cloud Data Security Platform

Unified Cloud Data Security - Tangled Web

The more complex and diverse an enterprise’s cloud investment, the more critical it becomes to secure that cloud investment with a single, unified platform rather than a patchwork of different cloud security point solutions. A single platform will ensure consistent policy enforcement across all clouds and will ensure consistent anomaly reporting no matter which cloud the anomaly is detected in. A unified cloud security platform will prevent data or suspicious activity from falling through the cracks or escaping the eye of an overloaded administrator. And a single platform that can be integrated with any cloud app you choose will remove the limitations on your cloud security, enabling full and secure use of the cloud without sacrificing data security or monitoring capabilities.

Unified Cloud Data Security - Unified Platform

Today’s tangled web of cloud applications and cloud security demands requires a unified cloud data security platform to pull it all together and keep everything safe. Just one lapse could lead to a catastrophic data breach or costly compliance violation; flexibility and broad integration will prevent those from happening.
