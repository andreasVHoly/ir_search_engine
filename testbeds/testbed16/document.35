Cloud Computing Security

Cloud computing security refers to the controls that must be implemented in order to prevent the loss of data, information or resources belonging to a cloud services provider or its customers. Cloud solution providers must implement a variety of security controls for the SaaS (software as a service) solutions,PaaS (platform as a service) solutions and the IaaS (infrastructure as a service) solutions that they provide to their customers or clients.

As with traditional computer or data security, there are many bases that must be covered, in orderto ensure a safe computing environment. Computer security (including cloud computing security)can be implemented by taking the following security measures (as appropriate): restricting access to applications and system resources, logging access & use of applications and systems; and controlling & monitoring access to physical computing resources like servers & data centers, etc.

Many of the security methods that cloud service providers implement are driven by privacy, compliance or legal rules for managing consumer data that specific industries must adhere to. In any event, security breeches can result in major financial losses for any organization, as costly fines and legal expenses may be incurred; along side a loss of confidence in the organization’s ability to protect customer data, which can lead to further losses in business revenue.

PUBLIC CLOUD COMPUTING SECURITY

Since Cloud Computing is an newly evolving model for the delivery of software, platforms and infrastructure; it provides a new set of challenges to IT network and data security personnel. Most organizations that are considering moving their applications to the cloud have a variety of security concerns, which are in many ways, certainly warranted. Ironically, in some cases, a public cloud may provide better security for data and IT resources than what could be provided by a firm’s on-premise IT staff; as the element of employee loss or theft of data or computing assets is significantly reduced when an enterprise uses a public cloud services provider to deliver IT services to the organization. Nevertheless,while public cloud service providers may be able to significantly reduce the threat of employee loss or theft of data or IT assets, they still must competently guard against the outside threat that is intrinsic to delivering services via the Internet: hackers who can launch an attack against the public cloud services being delivered by a cloud service provider.

PRIVATE CLOUD COMPUTING SECURITY

Private clouds offer the framework for a more secure computing environment than what is available within the sphere of public clouds. Along these lines, many organizations with high security requirements frequently opt to deliver IT services via an enterprise private cloud, which is secured by a network firewall. The implementation of an enterprise private cloud provides organizations with the maximum level of control over their data, applications and systems. An enterprise private cloud eliminates threats from Internet hackers, as well as reducing the occurrence of intellectual property theft, which could easily occur if a company stores its sensitive data and proprietary information in a public cloud. Apprenda’s Private PaaS (platform as a service) offering serves as an ideal solution for organizations who want to seamlessly and securely deliver cloud computing services via an enterprise private cloud.
