Joining Citrix as Chief Cloud Advocate

I'm happy to announce that effective immediately I've joined Citrix (NASDAQ: CTXS) as the company's first Chief Cloud Advocate.

In this role I will lead Citrix's cloud advocacy efforts with a particular focus on increasing the volume, reach and influence of Citrix's extensive portfolio of cloud solutions used by more then 260,000 customers and 100 million end users across the globe.

Among the many challenges I will be facing is the chance to increase the adoption of the various Open Source initiatives at Citrix as well the chance to work with others in the cloud computing space.

I am very excited and honoured to have the chance to join this innovative fast growing company. If you'd like to discuss anything or have an opportunity you'd like to collaborate on, please feel to reach out to me.
