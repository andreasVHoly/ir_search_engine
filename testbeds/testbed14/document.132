ABSTRACT
Motivation:
The importance of extracting biomedical information from scientific publications is well recognized. A number of
information extraction systems for the biomedical domain have
been reported, but none of them have become widely used
in practical applications. Most proposals to date make rather
simplistic assumptions about the syntactic aspect of natural
language. There is an urgent need for a system that has broad
coverage and performs well in real-text applications.
Results:
We present a general biomedical domain-oriented
NLP engine called MedScan that efficiently processes sentences from MEDLINE abstracts and produces a set of
regularized logical structures representing the meaning of
each sentence. The engine utilizes a specially developed
context-free grammar and lexicon. Preliminary evaluation of
the system’s performance, accuracy, and coverage exhibited
encouraging results. Further approaches for increasing the
coverage and reducing parsing ambiguity of the engine, as
well as its application for information extraction are discussed.

INTRODUCTION
The need for automated data retrieval from biomedical publications is well recognized, given their exponentially increasing
volume. Due to easy access and availability, the most widely
used sources of scientific information are abstracts of scientific publications, accessed primarily through MEDLINE.
Abstracts contain a concise description of the information
within the paper and provide the best combination of availability, information density and brevity. Many approaches
have been proposed for information extraction (IE) from scientific publications, ranging from simple statistical methods
to advanced natural language processing (NLP) systems.
