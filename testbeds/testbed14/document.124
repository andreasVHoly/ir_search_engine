Since ontologies are widely used for different purposes (natural language processing, knowledge
management, e-commerce, intelligent integration information, the semantic web, etc.) in different
communities (i.e., knowledge engineering, databases and software engineering), Uschold and
Jasper [69] provided a new definition of the word ontology to popularize it in other disciplines.
Note that the database community, as well as the object-oriented community, also builds domain
models using concepts, relations, properties, etc., but most of the times both communities impose
less semantic constraints than those imposed in heavyweight ontologies. Uschold and Jasper
defined an ontology as follows: ‘‘An ontology may take a variety of forms, but it will necessarily
include a vocabulary of terms and some specification of their meaning. This includes definitions
and an indication of how concepts are inter-related which collectively impose a structure on the
domain and constrain the possible interpretations of terms.’’
In this section we have collected the most relevant definitions, although there are other definitions of the word ‘‘ontology’’ in literature. However, we can say that there is consensus among
the ontology community and so there is not confusion about its usage. Different definitions
provide different and complementary points of view of the same reality. Some authors provide
definitions that are independent of the processes followed to build the ontology and also independent
of its use in applications, while other definitions are influenced by the ontology development
process. As a main conclusion to this section, we can say that ontologies aim to capture
consensual knowledge in a generic and formal way, and that they may be reused and shared across
applications (software) and by groups of people. Ontologies are usually built cooperatively by a
group of people in different locations.
