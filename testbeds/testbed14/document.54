3. ONTOLOGY METHODOLOGY: A SURVEY
Basically, a series of approaches have been reported for developing ontologies. In 1990, Lenat
and Guha published the general steps and some interesting points about the Cyc development.
Initially, the Enterprise Ontology and the TOVE (TOronto Virtual Enterprise) project ontology
had been proposed in the domain of enterprise modeling. Bernaras et al. presented a method used
to build ontology in the domain of electrical networks as part of the Esprit KACTUS project. The
methodology METHONTOLOGY appeared at the same time. In 1997, a new method was
proposed for building ontologies based on the SENSUS ontology. Some years later, the On-ToKnowledge
methodology appeared as a result of the project with the same name. However, all
these methods and methodologies do not consider collaborative and distributed construction of
ontologies. In this paper, we are describing some of the methodologies for building ontologies [1].
3.2 Gruninger And Fox Methodology
Gruninger and Fox proposed a methodology that is inspired on the development of knowledge based
systems using first order logic. This methodology has been suggested as TOVE project
ontology within domain of business processes and activities modeling. This represents logical
model of knowledge. The steps are: 1) Capture the motivating scenarios. 2) Formulation of
informal competency questions, where the scope of the ontology can be decided. 3) Formulation

of formal competency questions, which specify the terminology with definition and constraints.
4) Specification of axioms and definition within the formal language. 5) Finally, specify the
conditions under which the solutions to the questions are complete. In this methodology, the
ontology can be built by using questions and answers for motivating scenarios, which represents
main concepts, properties, relations and axioms on the ontology [1][2]. The methodology will
extend the scope but the procedure is complex.
