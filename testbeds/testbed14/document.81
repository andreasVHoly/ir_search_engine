Analysis
Laboratory (FOCAL)
The Future Operations Centre Analysis Laboratory
(FOCAL) is a research project whose goal is to
"pioneer
a
paradigm
shift
in
command
environments through a superior use of capability
and greater situation awareness" (FOCAL Task
Plan). In part, this involves building a high-level
information fusion system for the military domain
(Lambert, 2003; FOCAL, 2002).
To support this goal, the FOCAL facility was
designed
to
experiment
with
innovative
technologies. FOCAL contains a large-screen
(150
°
) semi-immersive virtual reality environment
as its primary display, allowing vast quantities of
information (real or virtual) to be displayed.
Spoken dialogue with virtual characters known as
VAs (Virtual Advisers) is one of the means of
delivering information (Estival et al., 2003).
Within the FOCAL project, the Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and the Knowledge
Representation
and
Reasoning
(KR)
work
packages are tasked with providing appropriate
NLP and KR functionalities, including processing
natural language queries and providing a
formalisation of the domain and reasoning
capabilities. These two work packages are closely
related in that a natural language query is to be
processed, mapped to its formal representation and
answered by a reasoning subsystem, and then a
natural language answer is returned to the user.
Current
FOCAL
work
is
focused
on
implementing a scenario, which is located within a
particular military situation and describes a
military domain, a limited (in space and time)
region of the world, and other relevant elements of
that situation. Among other things, the domain
description requires dealing with geography,
logistics and planning.
The FOCAL architecture is agent-based and
uses the CoABS (Control of Agent Based Systems)
Grid as its infrastructure (Global InfoTek, 2002).
The CoABS Grid was designed to allow a large
number of heterogeneous procedural, object-
oriented and agent-based systems to communicate.
FOCAL agents process information, communicate
and collaborate. Most agents are implemented in
ATTITUDE
and communication between agents is
accomplished via string messages (Wark et al.,
2004).
Humans are also involved in FOCAL, as the end
users who interact with the system to perform their
work and achieve their goal: successfully planning
and conducting an operation. The current scenario
provides a testbed for the system. Extensions of
the scenario and new scenarios for different
domains will ensure that FOCAL functions as
expected outside of the limited domain of the
current scenario.
There are many aspects of FOCAL which are
not directly related to NLP and KR activities, and
which are therefore excluded from this discussion.
In the rest of this paper, only aspects relevant to
NLP and KR are considered.
