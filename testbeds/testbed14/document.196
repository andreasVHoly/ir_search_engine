3.6 Other Reasoning Techniques
Although the tableau based approach is currently the most widely used technique
for reasoning in DLs, other approaches have been developed as well. In general, a
reasoning algorithm can be used in an implementation, or to prove a decidability or
computational complexity result. Certain approaches may (for a given logic) be better
suited for the former task, whereas others may be better suited for the latter—and it is
sometimes hard to find one that is well-suited for both. Examples of other approaches
are the automata based approach, the structural subsumption approach, the resolution
based approach, and translation based approaches. For certain logics and tasks, other
approaches turn out to be superior to the tableau based approach. For example, it is not
clear how the polynomiality result for subsumption in EL with GCIs [42, 6], which
uses a structural subsumption algorithm, could be obtained with the help of a tableau
based algorithm. Similarly, the automata based approach can be used to show that satisfiability
and subsumption of �LC concepts with respect to TBoxes can be decided
within exponential time [49, 117, 116, 159],
6 whereas this is very hard to prove using
a tableau based approach [66]. Resolution based approaches [103, 5, 104, 107], which
use the translation of DLs into first-order predicate logic, may have the advantage
that they simultaneously yield a decision procedure for a certain decidable DL, and a
semidecision procedure for a more expressive logic (such as OWL Full or first-order

predicate logic). Moreover, some of them are worst-case optimal [104], and others can
be implemented through appropriate parameterization of existing first-order theorem
provers [103]. Finally, the translation of very expressive DLs into propositional dynamic
logic or the propositional mu-calculus [57, 58, 56, 59] allows one to transfer
known decidability and complexity results for these logics to very expressive DLs.
It is not clear how these results could be obtained with the help of the tableau based
approach.
