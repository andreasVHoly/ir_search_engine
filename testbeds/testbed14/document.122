Top Down Approaches
Top-Down approaches start from the most generic concept and build a structure by
specialization; the ontology is built by determining first the top concepts and by
specializing them. The top concepts can be chose in a foundational ontology These
approaches are prone to the reuse of ontologies and inclusion of high level philosophical considerations which can be very interesting for coherence maintenance
(Gandon 2002).
An example of a methodology for a top down approach would DOLCE and BFO. They are used widely.
Example: A Socio Cultural Ontology
Human activity creates some geographical object like state, city, administrative border.
These types of geographical objects are opposed to physical object like mountains,
rivers. Trausan-Matu (2007) describe urban development as the consequence of
human activity. He uses a top down approach to develop its socio cultural ontology.
This ontology explains the human interaction inherent in urban development. He
adapts the John Sowa’s methodology of classification (Sowa 1999) to the activity
theory of Engestrom. This ontology is presented in the Chap. 9.32
C. Roussey et al.
Example: Urban Morphological Process Ontology
Camacho-Hubner and Golay (2007) propose to use John Sowa’s methodology to
develop an ontology of urban morphological change. Their goal is to explain the
change of urban morphology by studying 3 aspects: time, historical context and
morphological process.
