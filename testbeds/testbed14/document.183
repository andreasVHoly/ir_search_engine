History[edit]
The company was founded in Mountain View, California in January, 2003 by Chris Stolte, Christian Chabot and Pat Hanrahan.[3] Their initial aim was to commercialize research conducted at Stanford University’s Department of Computer Science between 1999 and 2002.[4] Professor Pat Hanrahan and Ph.D. student Chris Stolte who specialized in visualization techniques for exploring and analyzing relational databases and data cubes[5] led research in the use of table-based displays to browse multidimensional relational databases.[6] Together, they combined a structured query language for databases with a descriptive language for rendering graphics and invented a database visualization language called VizQL (Visual Query Language).[7] VizQL formed the core of the Polaris system, an interface for exploring large multi-dimensional databases.[8] In 2003, Tableau was spun out of Stanford [9] with an eponymous software application. The product queries relational databases, cubes, cloud databases, and spreadsheets and then generates a number of graph types that can be combined into dashboards and shared over a computer network or the internet. The founders moved the company to Seattle, Washington in October, 2003, where it remains headquartered today.[10]
On May 17, 2013, Tableau launched an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange, raising more than $250 million USD.[11] Prior to its IPO, Tableau raised over $45 million in venture capital investment from investors such as NEA and Meritech.[11]
The company's 2013 revenue reached $232.44 million, an 82% growth over 2012's $128 million.[12] In 2010, Tableau reported revenue of $34.2 million. That figure grew to $62.4 million in 2011 and $127.7 million in 2012. Profit during the same periods came to $2.7 million, $3.4 million, and $1.6 million, respectively.[13]

Withdrawal of services from Wikileaks[edit]
On December 2, 2010, Tableau was one of the first companies to withdraw support from WikiLeaks after they started publishing US embassy cables.[21] Although the company stated it was not a decision that they took lightly,[22] they also stated it was directly due to political pressure:
Our decision to remove the data from our servers came in response to a public request by Senator Joe Lieberman, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee, when he called for organizations hosting WikiLeaks to terminate their relationship with the website.
On February 21, 2011, Tableau posted an updated data policy.[23] The accompanying blog post cited the two main changes as (1) creating a formal complaint process and (2) using freedom of speech as a guiding principle.[24] In addition, the post announced the creation of an advisory board to help the company navigate future situations that "push the boundaries of the policy."[24] Robert Kosara of Tableau likened the new policy to the model set forth in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and opined that under the new policy, the Wikileaks cables would not have been removed.[25]
