Basically, a series of approaches have been reported for developing ontologies. In 1990, Lenat
and Guha published the general steps and some interesting points about the Cyc development.
Initially, the Enterprise Ontology and the TOVE (TOronto Virtual Enterprise) project ontology
had been proposed in the domain of enterprise modeling. Bernaras et al. presented a method used
to build ontology in the domain of electrical networks as part of the Esprit KACTUS project. The
methodology METHONTOLOGY appeared at the same time.
In 1997, a new method was
proposed for building ontologies based on the SENSUS ontology. Some years later, the On-To-
Knowledge methodology appeared as a result of the project with the same name. However, all
these methods and methodologies do not consider collaborative and distributed construction of 
ontologies. In this paper, we are describing some of the methodologies for building ontologies [1].
3.1 Skeleton Methodology
This methodology is based on the experience of developing the Enterprise Ontology, ontology for
enterprise modeling processes. A plan or draft for a project along with activities can be
represented as ontology. The steps are, first, identify the main purpose of the ontology, second
build the ontology, where the key concepts and its
relationships can be captured and third, code it
with proper language and may be integrated with existing ontology. We can use either top-down
or bottom-up approach to represent the ontology [1]
[2]. This method is simple to implement but
limited to scope.
