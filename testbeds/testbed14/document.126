The Uschold and King’s method [70] proposes four activities: (1) to identify the purpose of the
ontology, (2) to build it, (3) to evaluate it, and (4) to document it. During the building activity, the
authors propose capturing knowledge, coding it and integrating other ontologies inside the current
one. The authors also propose three strategies for identifying the main concepts in the ontology: a
top-down approach, in which the most abstract concepts are identified first, and then, specialized
into more specific concepts; a bottom-up approach, in which the most specific concepts are identified
first and then generalized into more abstract concepts; and a middle-out approach, in which the most
important concepts are identified first and then generalized and specialized into other concepts.
Gr€uuninger and Fox
[33] propose a methodology that is inspired on the development of
knowledge-based systems using first order logic. They propose first to identify intuitively the main
scenarios (possible applications in which the ontology will be used). Then, a set of natural language questions, called competency questions, are used to determine the scope of the ontology.
These questions and their answers are used both to extract the main concepts and their properties,
relations and axioms on the ontology. Such ontology components are formally expressed in first order logic. Therefore, this is a very formal method that takes advantage of the robustness of
classic logic. It can be used as a guide to transform informal scenarios in computable models.
