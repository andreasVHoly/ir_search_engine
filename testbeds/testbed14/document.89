Abstract
We present Natural
owl
, a natural language generation system that produces texts
describing individuals or classes of
owl
ontologies. Unlike simpler
owl
verbalizers, which
typically express a single axiom at a time in controlled, often not entirely uent natural
language primarily for the bene t of domain experts, we aim to generate uent and coherent multi-sentence texts for end-users. With a system like Natural
owl
, one can publish
information in
owl
on the Web, along with automatically produced corresponding texts
in multiple languages, making the information accessible not only to computer programs
and domain experts, but also end-users. We discuss the processing stages of Natural
owl
,
the optional domain-dependent linguistic resources that the system can use at each stage,
and why they are useful. We also present trials showing that when the domain-dependent
linguistic resources are available, Natural
owl
produces significantly better texts compared
to a simpler verbalizer, and that the resources can be created with relatively light e ort.
1. Introduction
Ontologies play a central role in the Semantic Web (Berners-Lee, Hendler, & Lassila, 2001;
Shadbolt, Berners-Lee, & Hall, 2006). Each ontology provides a conceptualization of a
knowledge domain (e.g., consumer electronics) by defining the classes and subclasses of the
individuals (entities) in the domain, the types of possible relations between them etc. The
current standard to specify Semantic Web ontologies is
owl
(Horrocks, Patel-Schneider,
& van Harmelen, 2003), a formal language based on description logics (Baader, Calvanese,
McGuinness, Nardi, & Patel-Schneider, 2002),
rdf
, and
rdf schema
(Antoniou & van
Harmelen, 2008), with
owl2
being the latest version of
owl
(Grau, Horrocks, Motik, Parc
