U.S. Pat. No. 4,887,212 to Zamora et al. discloses a parser for syntactic analysis of text using a fast and compact technique. After part-of-speech tagging and disambiguation, syntactic analysis occurs in four steps. The grammar of Zamora et al. operates by making multiple passes to guess at noun phrases and verb phrases and then attempts to reconcile the results. Furthermore, the grammar violation checking technique of the Zamora et al. system checks only for syntactic correctness.
U.S. Pat. No. 4,914,590 to Loatman et al. discloses a natural language understanding system. The goal of the Loatman et al. system is to provide a formal representation of the context of a sentence, not merely the sentence itself. Case frames used in Loatman et al. require substantial hard-coded information to be programmed about each word, and a large number of case frames must be provided to obtain reasonable coverage.
Tokuume et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,101,349, discloses a natural language processing system that makes provisions for validating grammar from the standpoint of syntactic well-formedness, but does not provide facilities for validating the semantic well-formedness of feature structures.
U.S. Pat. No. 5,146,496 to Jensen discloses a technique for identifying predicate-argument relationships in natural language text. The Jensen system must create intermediate feature structures to store semantic roles, which are then used to fill in predicates whose deep structures have missing arguments. Post-parsing analysis is needed and the parsing time is impacted by the maintenance of these variables. Additionally, semantic feature compatibility checking is not possible with Jensen's system.
