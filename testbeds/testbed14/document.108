Techniques for attempting to bridge the semantic gap in multimedia retrieval
have mostly used an
auto-annotation
approach, in which keyword annotations
are applied to unlabelled images. Enser et al. [6] discuss some short-comings of
auto-annotation due to their lack of
richness
when compared to real image annotations in archival collections. Enser et al. [6] goes on to suggest that perhaps a
way forward is to combine shareable ontologies to make explicit the relationships
between the keyword labels and concepts they represent (e.g
[7, 8, 9]). Zhao and
Grosky [10] proposed an approach to bridging the semantic gap using Latent
Semantic Indexing (see also [11, 12]).
This paper describes our experiences in building multimedia retrieval systems, and how through various techniques we are attempting to bridge the semantic gap to improve retrieval quality for end users. Our approaches to attacking this gap have been twofold; In the first section of the paper we describe some
attempts to automatically learn and apply the semantics of multimedia objects
from the bottom-up. In the second section, we describe our work in trying to
bridge the gap from the top down, by using structured knowledge representations
in the form of ontologies.
The third section of the paper discusses our current work and
ideas for combining these bottom-up and top-down approaches to further our goal of improved
retrieval effectiveness.
