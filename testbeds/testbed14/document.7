1. Introduction
Research on Description Logics has covered theoretical underpinnings as well as implementation of knowledge representation systems and the development of applications in several areas. This kind of development has been quite successful. The key element has been the methodology of research, based on a very close interaction between theory and practice. On the one hand, there are various implemented systems based on Description Logics, which offer a palette of description formalisms with differing expressive power, and which are employed in various application domains (such as natural language processing, configuration of technical products, or databases). On the other hand, the formal and computational properties of reason- ing (like decidability and complexity) of various description formalisms have been investigated in detail. The investigations are usually motivated by the use of certain constructors in implemented systems or by the need for these constructors in specific applications—and the results have influenced the design of new systems.
This book is meant to provide a thorough introduction to Description Logics, covering all the above-mentioned aspects of DL research—namely theory, implementation, and applications. Consequently, the book is divided into three parts:
Part I introduces the theoretical foundations of Description Logics, addressing some of the most recent developments in theoretical research in the area;
Part II focuses on the implementation of knowledge representation systems based on Description Logics, describing the basic functionality of a DL system, survey- ing the most influential knowledge representation systems based on Description Logics, and addressing specialized implementation techniques;
Part III addresses the use of Description Logics and of DL-based systems in the design of several applications of practical interest.
In the remainder of this introductory chapter, we review the main steps in the development of Description Logics, and introduce the main issues that are dealt with later in the book, providing pointers for its reading. In particular, in the next section we address the origins of Description Logics and then we review knowledge representation systems based on Description Logics, the main applications developed with Description Logics, the main extensions to the basic DL framework and relationships with other fields of Computer Science.
