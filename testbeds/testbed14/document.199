The Semantic Web has been envisaged as an evolution of the existing Web
from a linked document repository into an application platform where “information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people
to work in cooperation”
[Berners-Lee
et al., 2001]. This is to be achieved by
augmenting the existing layout information with semantic annotations that
add descriptive terms to Web content, with the meaning of such terms being
defined in ontologies.
In order for the meaning of semantic annotations to be accessible to applications (as well as humans), the ontology language being used should have a
precisely defined semantics and should be amenable to automated processing. Description Logics appear to be ideally suited to this role: they have
a formal logic-based semantics, and are often equipped with decision procedures that have been designed with the objective of being implemented
in automated reasoning systems. This view of the potential place of Description Logics in the Semantic Web led to the development of a number of
languages that brought Description Logic concepts to the Semantic Web, culminating in the development of the Web Ontology Language OWL. OWL is
the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommended ontology language
for the Semantic Web, and exploits many of the strengths of Description
Logics, including well defined semantics and practical reasoning techniques.
In this chapter we first review briefly the history of Description Logic
efforts related to the Semantic Web, in particular
OIL and DAML+OIL.
We then go on to describe OWL in some detail, and to show how it brings
Description Logic concepts fully into the Semantic Web.
