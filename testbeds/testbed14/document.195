3.4 Tableau Based Reasoning Techniques
A variety of reasoning techniques can be used to solve the reasoning problems introduced
in Section 3.2. These include resolution based approaches [102, 104], automata
based approaches [49, 161], and structural approaches (for sub-Boolean DLs) [6]. The
most widely used technique, however, is the tableau based approach first introduced
by Schmidt-Schauß and Smolka [149]. In this section, we described this technique for
the case of our basic DL �LC.
3.4.1 A Tableau Algorithm for ALC
We will concentrate on knowledge base consistency because, as we have seen in Section
3.2, this is a very general problem to which many others can be reduced. For
F. Baader, I. Horrocks, U. Sattler 147
example, given a knowledge base K = (T , �), a concept C is subsumed by a concept
D with respect to K (K |= C � D) iff (T , � ∪ {x : (C � ¬D)}) is not consistent,
where x is a new individual name (i.e., one that does not occur in K). For �LC with
a general TBox, i.e., one where the TBox is not restricted to contain only definitorial
axioms (see Section 3.2), this problem is known to be EXPTIME-complete [144].
The tableau based decision procedure for the consistency of general �LC knowledge
bases sketched below (and described in more detail in [12, 14]), runs in worst case
non-deterministic double exponential time.
