Keywords:

We present a detailed semantics for linguistic spatial expressions supportive of computational
processing that draws substantially on the principles and tools of ontological engineering
and formal ontology. We cover language concerned with space, actions in space
and spatial relationships and develop an ontological organization that relates such expressions
to general classes of fixed semantic import. The result is given as an extension of a
linguistic ontology, the Generalized Upper Model, an organization which has been used for
over a decade in natural language processing applications. We describe the general nature
and features of this ontology and show how we have extended it for working particularly
with space. Treating the semantics of natural language expressions concerning space
in this way offers a substantial simplification of the general problem of relating natural
spatial language to its contextualized interpretation. Example specifications based on natural
language examples are presented, as well as an evaluation of the ontology’s coverage,
consistency, predictive power, and applicability.

1. Introduction
The relation between language and space has long been an area of active research (cf. [152,74,106,27,28,154,111]). Human
languages impose particular linguistic constructions of space, of spatially-anchored events, and of spatial configurations
that relate in complex ways to the spatial situations in which they are used. Establishing tighter formal specifications
of this relationship has proved a considerable challenge and has so far eluded general solutions. One reason for this is
that the precise nature of the contribution made by spatial language has been conceived too simply. In much earlier and
ongoing work, language is assumed to offer a relatively simple inventory of terms for which spatial interpretations can be
directly stated. Examples of this can be found not only in accounts that focus on formalizations of particular tasks, such
as path descriptions [112], scene descriptions [33], navigation and way-finding [158,163,140], but also in foundational work
on the formal ontology of space [30,120,22], on qualitative spatial calculi [43,42], and on cognitive approaches involving,
for example, image schemas [135,97]. In all of these approaches the principal burden of explanation is located within
the non-linguistic formalizations pursued. This produces characterizations of spatial semantics that mirror the tasks and
formal criteria addressed rather than the properties required for treating spatial language. As we shall argue below, such
characterizations turn out to be ill-suited for dealing with the extreme flexibility of spatial language use observable in real
contexts.
To bring the flexibility of spatial language use under control, we pursue a detailed formalization of what language itself
brings to the interpretation of space. In particular, we consider language as contributing a structure of the spatial world that
can be formulated as an ontology. This organization provides an additional layer of ontological information that formalizes
the ‘semantic commitments’ entered into by any linguistic spatial construction. Such semantic commitments are intended
to capture precisely the degree of formalization required to explain the linguistic options taken up while at the same time
avoiding over-commitment with respect to the physical or conceptual spatial situations in which those linguistic options may
be exercised. This then serves as an intermediate ‘interface ontology’ supporting mediation between linguistic forms on the
one hand and contextualized interpretations on the other. We organize this intermediate layer around the central notion of
‘spatial modalities’, abstract categories that group collections of similarly functioning linguistic spatial constructions together
without committing to particular contextual interpretations. For example, linguistic constructions involving the prepositions
‘at’, ‘near’ and so on are related to the spatial modality Proximal, which stands in contrast to Distal and is a superconcept
of spatial modalities involved with lateral (left–right) and frontal (front–back) ‘projection’. The characterization of the linguistic
expression “Bill is waiting at the post office” as expressing the spatial modality Proximal then makes commitments
to a functional connection between the person waiting and the post office without (wrongly) committing to a spatial contextualization
involving containment; both inside and outside the post office are still compatible with descriptions with ‘at’.
An expression ‘near the post office’ brings in addition a contribution from the spatial modality Disjointness and so overlaps
with, but is distinct from, ‘at’. The interface ontology as a whole provides a rich web of semantic inter-relationships; each
of the spatial modalities we define brings with it semantic commitments that help constrain appropriate contextualizations.
This paper motivates the design of the ontology in depth and provides extensive details of its use.
Constructing a view of spatial semantics as an additional layer of ontology in this way brings several advantages crucial
for adequately capturing the relationship between language use and spatial interpretation. First, it supports the application
of the full range of methods developed within ontological engineering and applied ontology in order to organize the information
necessary in ways that conform to a strict and formally specified modeling style [65,67,148]. Second, it provides
a suitable level of abstraction for dealing effectively with spatial language and for describing what linguistic expressions
themselves bring to the interpretation process—something that has not been found possible when focusing on linguistic elements
as isolated terms. And third, it allows the relationship between linguistic expressions and spatial interpretation to be
recast as a particular case of ontological alignment, or mediation, whereby two or more distinct ontologies are brought into
a formal relationship [89,100,99,80,98]. Combining these considerations establishes a formally robust and well grounded
framework from which to consider the full flexibility required for dealing with the mapping between language and space.
A distinct, well-defined and empirically-motivated layer of semantics for spatial language of this kind has direct applications
for many currently relevant tasks involving spatial language. These include attempts to support communication via
natural language with the human users of Geographic Information Systems [21,118,97,24], of context-based services [20],
and of devices operating in space, such as situated robots [137,122,96]. In addition, the growing demand for automatic enrichment
of textual data with spatial annotations in the context of the semantic web raises precisely analogous issues [116].
In all of these areas, solutions to the language–space mapping problem are urgently required. We also suggest that the
organization we propose is equally relevant as a contribution to the linguistic discussion of space, particularly concerning
how the interpretation of spatial language can be managed.
We organize our discussion as follows. In Section 2 we establish precisely why we consider spatial language to demand
its own layer of ontological description. We then present in Section 3 two examples of linguistic spatial descriptions illustrating
the general spatial categories of our linguistic ontology and their connection both to natural language constructions
and to formal contextualized interpretations. In Section 4 we turn to the detailed structure and definitions of our linguistic
ontology, including illustrative examples. Section 5 discusses issues concerning applicability and use of the ontology, and
in Section 6 we address evaluation—itself now an area of increasing importance for ontological engineering in general. In
Section 7, we conclude with a summary of what has been achieved and consider future research tasks.
2. The case for a linguistic ontology for space
Our claim is that the processing of authentic spatial language requires a particular kind of knowledge to be captured—
knowledge concerning the range of spatially-related meanings that language itself, or languages themselves, construct. This
knowledge and its organization have been dealt with inadequately hitherto despite the fact that much is now known
concerning the linguistic construction of space. Linguistic investigations of spatial semantics, particularly approaches from
Talmy, Langacker, Vandeloise, Bierwisch, Lang, Levinson and others [152,155,106,25,105,161,110], have revealed broadly similar
mechanisms at work across cultures and types of language use and a considerable body of work has emerged building
on these foundations. Detailed studies of spatial language use can be found in contexts ranging over formal semantic interpretations,
psychological studies, dialogue analysis, computational modeling and many more [128,159,160,36,157,7,44]. The
insights gained in this tradition provide the starting point for the formalization we propose. It is of particular importance to
be clear about just how substantial this previous work is and, for this reason, our bibliographical references are extensive—
although still by no means exhaustive. So far, few attempts have been made to bring this substantial body of information
together within a unified account supportive of automatic processing. We propose here for the first time a comprehensive
approach to combining the various contributions that also relates them to non-linguistic spatial interpretations.
