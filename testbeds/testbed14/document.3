A Description Logic (DL) is a structured fragment of FOL; more precisely: any (basic)
Description Logic language is a subset of L3, i.e., the function-free FOL using only at
most three variable names, and its representation is at the predicate level: no variables
are present in the formalism. DLs provide a logical reconstruction and (claimed to be a)
unifying formalism for other knowledge representation languages, such as frames-based
systems, object-oriented modelling, Semantic data models, etc. They provide the language
to formulate theories and systems declaratively expressing structured information
and for accessing and reasoning with it, and they are used for, among others, terminologies
and ontologies, formal conceptual data modelling, and information integration.
Figure 3.1 shows a basic overview of the principal components of a DL knowledge
base, with the so-called TBox containing the knowledge at the class-level and the ABox
containing the data (individuals). Sometimes you will see added to the figure an RBox,
which is used to make explicit there are relationships and the axioms that hold for them.

The remainder of this section contains, first, a general introduction to DL (Section
3.1), which are the first five sections of the DL Primer [Kr¨otzsch et al., 2012], and
is reproduced here with permission of its authors Markus Kr¨otzsch, Frantiˇsek Simanˇc´ık,

36 Chapter 3. Description Logics
and Ian Horrocks. This is followed by a shorter notation style for the DL language ALC
in Section 3.2, which one encounters typically in the literature (based on Section 3.1,
this should be understandable, and it will pass the revue during the lectures); slightly
more detailed introductory notes with examples can be found in the first 8 pages of
[Turhan, 2010] and the first 10 pages of [Sattler, 2007]. We close with describing and
illustrating the standard reasoning services for DLs in Section 3.3. Note that DLs and its
reasoning services return in Chapter 4 about OWL 2, building upon these foundations.
