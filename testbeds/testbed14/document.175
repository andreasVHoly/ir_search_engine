This report is based on a continuous research since five years ago. Some research results in this report are collected from my proposal and several publications. The contributions are as follows:
(1) The dynamic blocking technique [HS02] has been adapted to a dynamic global tableaux caching technique (as shown for the DL ALCI in this report). The proposed dynamic global tableaux caching technique (first appeared in [DH05]) exemplifies a general mechanism of anywhere blocking7 for a family of DLs with inverse roles.
(2) An equivalence8 about a role and its inverse was (re)discovered in the area of description logics during the course of this research. In [DH05] we pointed out its 7Recently a pairwise anywhere blocking technique was introduced in [MSH07] for SHIQ. 8This equivalence and the dynamic global tableaux caching technique were reported in the report proposal and were later presented in [DH05]. In 2006, the author of this report found out that this equivalence is a variant of the Ramsey Rule [Ram31] in modal logics. Related research for developing new absorption algorithms include [HW06, SGP06].

promising application to absorption algorithms [HT00]. A new framework [HW06] considered this equivalence and extended [HT00] in many aspects for designing absorption algorithms. Recently in [WH08], by combining with planning techniques, a general usage of this equivalence (allowing a recursive extraction of usable concept names) successfully transformed several very hard ontologies (from the model checking field [BDTW07]) into KBs without GCIs and showed orders of magnitude performance gain in experiments. Also related to this equivalence is a result [DHW07]
showing that any unfoldable Tbox in SHOI can be transformed into an unfoldable Tbox in SHO while preserving concept satisfiability.
(3) A methodology to eliminate inverse roles for a family of DLs having inverse roles (e.g., from SHOI to SHO, and from ALCI Abox to ALC Abox).
(4) A worst-case optimal (ExpTime) tableau-based decision procedure for ALCFI is established. This is achieved by a sound global tableaux caching technique that is the most powerful of the three tableaux caching techniques proposed in this report.
It is quite promising that the same technique can be extended to SHIF, a DL
corresponding to the ontology language OWL-lite (see www.w3c.org).
(5) A simplified condition for the termination (a.k.a. blocking) of tableaux algorithms for DLs with inverse roles even when extended by qualified number restrictions. In contrast to the dynamic double blocking conditions previously known and popularly recognized today [HS99], the new termination condition is not only conceptually simple but also (potentially) practically easy for implementations. A straightforward application of this termination condition is a sound global tableaux caching for DLs
with qualified number restrictions and inverse roles (see below for SHIQ). When connecting to the depth-2 pattern brought up in [BHLW03, HM04, Hla04], the new condition is intuitively understandable and fits right to the notion of the depth-2 pattern.
(6) Based on the algebraic method [CL94, OK99, HM01a] and the integer linear programming technique [Pap81], we demonstrate a worst-case ExpTime (with improved upper bound) tableau-based decision procedure for SHIQ in the strong sense of a binary coding of numbers. This is achieved by the use of sound global tableaux caching and also by the use of a feasibility test for integer linear inequalities
