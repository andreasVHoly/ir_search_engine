Overview
DOLCE has a strong cognitive/linguistic bias. DOLCE uses a descriptive approach, which means that we represent what we know about the topic which may or may not be true. This is contrasted with the perscriptive approach.
This means that it has a descriptive attitude and that the categories reflect the lexical structure of natural language. 
DOLCE allows easy comparison with different ontological options 
It follows a rigorous, systematic, interdisciplinary approach. 
Rich axiomatization 
37 basic categories
