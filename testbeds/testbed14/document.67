In the
recent
years,  we
developed  a
methodology  for
testing  the  ontological
adequacy
of  taxonomic  links
called
OntoClean  [14,  13],  which  was
used  as   a
tool
for  a  first
systematic  analysis  of
WordNet’s
upper  level  taxonomy  of  nouns  [6].  The   first
version of OntoClean was based on  an  ontology  of  properties
(unary
universals
),  characterized by means  of  meta-properties.  We
are
now  complementing  OntoClean  with  an
ontology of
particulars
 called DOLCE  (Descriptive
Ontology  for  Linguistic
and
Cognitive Engineering), which is presented here in some detail.
DOLCE  is  the  first
module  of  a
Library  of  Foundational
Ontologies
  being
developed
within  the
WonderWeb
project
1
.   In   contrast   with   “lightweight”
ontologies,
which focus on a minimal terminological structure (often just  a  taxonomy)  fitting  the
needs  of  a
specific
community,  the  main  purpose  of
foundational
ontologies  is  to
negotiate meaning
, either  for  enabling
effective  cooperation
among  multiple
artificial
agents, or for
establishing consensus
 in a mixed society where artificial  agents
cooperate
with  human  beings.  The
WonderWeb
vision  is  to
have
a  library
  of  such  ontologies,
reflecting
different
ontological  choices.  The
idea  is   to
make  the  rationales  and
alternatives  underlying  such  choices  as  
explicit  as  possible,  as  a  result  of  a
careful
isolation  of  the
fundamental
ontological  options
and
their  formal  relationships.  The
library would form a network of different but systematically related modules  which  the
various  Semantic
Web
applications
can
commit  to,
according  to
their  ontological
assumptions.A
