Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an area of research and application that explores how
computers can be used to understand and manipulate natural language text or speech to do useful
things. NLP researchers aim to gather knowledge on how human beings understand and use
language so that appropriate tools and techniques can be developed to make computer systems
understand and manipulate natural languages to perform the desired tasks. The foundations of
NLP lie in a number of disciplines, viz. computer and information sciences, linguistics,
mathematics, electrical and electronic engineering, artificial intelligence and robotics,
psychology, etc. Applications of NLP include a number of fields of studies, such as machine
translation, natural language text processing and summarization, user interfaces, multilingual and
cross language information retrieval (CLIR), speech recognition, artificial intelligence and expert
systems, and so on.
One important area of application of NLP that is relatively new and has not been covered in the
previous ARIST chapters on NLP has become quite prominent due to the proliferation of the
world wide web and digital libraries. Several researchers have pointed out the need for
appropriate research in facilitating multi- or cross-lingual information retrieval, including
multilingual text processing and multilingual user interface systems, in order to exploit the full
benefit of the www and digital libraries (see for example, Borgman, 1997; Peters & Picchi, 1997)
Scope
Several ARIST chapters have reviewed the field of NLP. The most recent ones include that by
Warner in 1987, and Haas in 1996. Reviews of literature on large-scale NLP systems, as well as
the various theoretical issues have also appeared in a number of publications (see for example,
Jurafsky & Martin, 2000; Manning & Schutze, 1999; Mani & Maybury, 1999; Sparck Jones,
1999; Wilks, 1996). Smeaton (1999) provides a good overview of the past research on the
applications of NLP in various information retrieval tasks. Several ARIST chapters have
appeared on areas related to NLP, such as on machine-readable dictionaries (Amsler, 1984;
1
Evans, 1989), speech synthesis and recognition (Lange, 1993), and cross-language information
retrieval (Oard & Diekema, 1998). Research on NLP is regularly published in a number of
conferences such as the annual proceedings of ACL (Association of Computational Linguistics)
and its European counterpart EACL, biennial proceedings of the International Conference on
Computational Linguistics (COLING), annual proceedings of the Message Understanding
Conferences (MUCs), Text Retrieval Conferences (TRECs) and ACM-SIGIR (Association of
Computing Machinery ñ Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval) conferences. The most
prominent journals reporting NLP research are Computational Linguistics and Natural Language
Engineering. Articles reporting NLP research also appear in a number of information science
journals such as Information Processing and Management, Journal of the American Society for
Information Science and Technology, and Journal of Documentation. Several researchers have
also conducted domain-specific NLP studies and have reported them in journals specifically
dealing with the domain concerned, such as the International Journal of Medical Informatics and
Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Science.
Beginning with the basic issues of NLP, this chapter aims to chart the major research activities in
this area since the last ARIST Chapter in 1996 (Haas, 1996), including:
(i) natural language text processing systems ñ text summarization, information extraction,
information retrieval, etc., including domain-specific applications;
(ii) natural language interfaces;
(iii) NLP in the context of www and digital libraries ; and
(iv) evaluation of NLP systems.
Linguistic research in information retrieval has not been covered in this review, since this is a
huge area and has been dealt with separately in this volume by David Blair. Similarly, NLP issues
related to the information retrieval tools (search engines, etc.) for web search are not covered in
this chapter since a separate chapter on indexing and retrieval for the Web has been written in this
volume by Edie Rasmussen.
