In many areas of the engineering world, we frequently encounter various constraints regarding large integer values7. For example, the IPv4 (Inernet Protocol Version 4) specification stipulates that the header portion of each Transport Control Protocol (TCP) segment should have at least 10 fields and at most 11 fields; it is necessary to implement at least 4 different timers to develop the TCP protocol in IPv4; and the minimum transfer unit (MTU) of Ethernet Network must be at least 576 bytes, 7Yet there are applications using only very small numbers such as 1 or 2, as argued in [Hor02].
118 etc. It was pointed out in [HM01a] that the algebraic reasoner scales smoothly for large number values by implementing algorithms such as the simplex methods. A binary coding of integer numbers is exponentially succinct than a unary coding; the coding of numbers has been playing a critical role when it comes to examine if a decision procedure is indeed worst-case optimal for the satisfiability problems in DLs with number restrictions. In the past, it was not clear how the tableaubased approach could possibly achieve a worst-case ExpTime decision procedure in the strong sense of binary coding of number values. So far, the known ExpTime
decision procedure, allowing binary coding of numbers, is automaton-based [Tob01]. In that approach, a looping tree automaton is constructed for the given concept and the GCIs. The automaton is exponential in the size of the input and uses abstract limiting functions that are considered impractical for implementations [Tob01]. This chapter investigated the concept satisfiability problem in the DL SHIQ (w.r.t. general concept inclusions), and also investigates the applicability of the global (sub)-tableaux caching technique in tree structures restricted by local cardinality constraints and inverse relations. SHIQ is known to have the tree model property [BCM+03].
The global (sub)tableaux caching technique is inspired by [DM00]. We borrowed ideas and techniques from [Pap81, CL94, DM00], and [OK99, HM01a, Tob99, Tob01, HS02], and [BHLW03, HM04, Hla04, HM04]. The algebraic method has been extended and combined with the global (sub)-tableaux caching technique for a DL having number restrictions and inverse roles. The worst case complexity for the satisfiability problem in SHIQ is 2O(n2) , where n = T  + C in the strong sense of binary coding of numbers. This upper bound is also applicable to SHIQ Abox consistency 119 problems (even not assuming unique name assumption).
