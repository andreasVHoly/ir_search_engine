Overview
The proposed tutorial takes a detailed view of several human language technical aspects and current approaches that use NLP for automating Semantic Web-specific knowledge acquisition tasks. After a short introduction to the foundations of ontologies and the Semantic Web, the tutorial will focus on NLP technologies and their important role within applications such as ontology-based information extraction, ontology learning and population, or semantic metadata generation. Each of these technologies will be exemplified with descriptions of some key open-source NLP tools, thus enabling the participants to put their newly learned skills into practice. The tutorial will conclude by demonstrating several Semantic Web applications and the underlying data sets. \smallskip
Motivation
The Semantic Web aims at complementing the current text-based web with machine interpretable semantics to facilitate automated processing and integration of the vast amount of available information. The provision of such semantics, materialised in the tasks of ontology building and population, is a basic requirement for establishing the Semantic Web. However, as the manual construction of ontologies is very tedious and time-consuming, many people are still reluctant to add formal semantics to their websites. Automatic approaches such as methods for ontology learning and population can help to overcome this knowledge acquisition bottleneck by extracting relevant information from the Web and transforming it into a machine-processable representation. Given the enormous amount of textual data that is available online, it seems natural that these methods rely largely on the use of natural language processing techniques. The field of NLP has matured over the last decade to a point at which robust and scalable applications are possible in a variety of areas, and current Semantic Web projects are now poised to exploit this development. 
However, while NLP specialists have begun to realise and exploit the potential of their technology for the provision of semantics, the growth of the Semantic Web requires that experts from different domains (e.g. biology, law, tourism) build their own domain-specific tools for quick acquisition of semantics for their particular domain. The real challenges therefore are to bring NLP closer to ontology engineers from any background, and to extend current NLP techniques to ontology-based applications. This involves providing toolkits of basic NLP modules and, most importantly, guidelines for how these toolkits can be used for ontology enrichment activities and adapted to different domains. This tutorial will address these needs by:
providing an introduction to ontologies and the Semantic Web for NLP specialists,
describing methodologies for manual or automatic ontology construction, and
illustrating the techniques with examples of applications such as semantic annotation, ontology-based information extraction and ontology learning.
