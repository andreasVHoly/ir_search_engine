A foundational ontology
is also used with, among others, top-level domain ontologies, such as BioTop
[9], in the coordination of lightweight ontologies and thesauri in KOKO [10],
and with domain ontologies, e.g., [11, 12]. The underlying assumptions of the
proponents of the use of a foundational ontology are that ontology developers,
once introduced to foundational ontologies, naturally will use it, be it right from
the start or to align their ontology with one of them, because
i. it facilitates ontology development because one does not have to reinvent the
wheel concerning basic categories and relations, and
ii. using a foundational ontology improves overall quality and interoperability.
On the other hand, such foundational ontologies are criticised as being too abstract, too expressive, too comprehensive for `simple' or domain ontologies, and it
takes too much time to understand them in suficient detail. In addition, expressivity issues and the difference between a foundational ontology's take on how to
represent attributes (e.g.,with qualities and qualia), and OWL's data properties
with `application ontologies' (
de facto
, OWLized formal conceptual data models) for ontology-driven information systems increases the perceived gap further
[13]. Trying to answer whether the former or the latter stance holds cannot be
carried out by simply collecting all ontologies on the web through, e.g., Swoogle
or the TONES repository and counting the inclusion of a foundational ontology,
because a substantial amount of them are experimental or tutorial ontologies
or OWLized non-ontological resources (e.g., thesauri), one cannot always assess
their quality regarding correct representation of the subject domain, the choice
why a foundational ontology was used or not is unknown, and it is unknown
how much resources went into developing the ontologies; hence, with this much
uncertain parameters, one cannot draw any conclusions.
