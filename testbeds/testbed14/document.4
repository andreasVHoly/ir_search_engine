3.1 Description Logic primer
Description logics (DLs) are a family of knowledge representation languages that are
widely used in ontological modelling. An important practical reason for this is that
they provide one of the main underpinnings for the Web Ontology Language OWL as
standardised by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). However, Description Logics have been used
in knowledge representation long before the advent of ontological modelling in the context
of the Semantic Web, tracing back to first Description Logic modelling languages in the mid 1980s.
As their name suggests, Description Logics are logics (in fact they are decidable fragments of firstorder
logic), and as such they are equipped with a formal semantics: a precise specification
of the meaning of Description Logic ontologies. This formal semantics allows humans and computer
systems to exchange Description Logic ontologies without ambiguity as to their intended meaning, and
also makes it possible to use logical deduction to infer additional information from the
facts stated explicitly in an ontology â€“ an important feature that distinguishes Description Logics from
other modelling languages such as UML.
The capability of inferring additional knowledge increases the modelling power of
Description Logics but it also requires some understanding on the side of the modeller and, above all,
good tool support for computing the conclusions. The computation of inferences is called
reasoning and an important goal of Description Logic language design has been to ensure that reasoning
algorithms of good performance are available. This is one of the reasons why there is not
just a single description logic: the best balance between expressivity of the language and
complexity of reasoning depends on the intended application.
In this paper we provide a self-contained first introduction to description logics. We
start by explaining the basic way in which knowledge is modelled in DLs in Section 3.1.1
and continue with an intuitive introduction to the most important DL modelling features
in Section 3.1.2. This leads us to the rather expressive DL called SROIQ, the syntax of
which we summarise in Section 3.1.3. In Section 3.1.4, we explain the underlying ideas
of DL semantics and use it to define the meaning of SROIQ ontologies. Many DLs can
be obtained by omitting some features of SROIQ and in Section 3.1.5 we review some
of the most important DLs obtained in this way. In particular, this includes various
light-weight description logics that allow for particularly efficient reasoning
