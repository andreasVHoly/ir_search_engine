These problems are caused by the fact that most product information is provided in
natural language, and automatic text recognition is still a research area with significant
unsolved problems. However, the situation will drastically change in the near future
when standard representation formalisms for the structure and semantics of data are
available. Software agents then can

stores can be built with little effort and this technique will also enable complete market
transparency in the various dimensions of the diverse product properties. The low-level
programming of wrappers based on text extraction and format heuristics will be
replaced by XSL specifications, which translate different product descriptions in
various XML-dialects into each other. An ontology describes the various products and
can be used to navigate and search automatically for the required information. Section 4
will go into more details on the role of ontologies in Web Commerce.
Extranet = Electronic Business (B2B)
. Electronic Commerce in the business to
business field (B2B) is not a new phenomena. Initiatives to support electronic data
exchange in business processes between different companies existed already in the
sixties. In order to exchange business transactions sender and receiver have to agree on
a common standard (a protocol for transmitting the content and a language for
describing the content) A number of standards arose for this purpose. One of them is the
UN initiative 
Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce, and
Transport (EDIFACT) 
[EDIFACT]. Figure 2 provides an example for a specification of
a business transaction in EDIFACT. 
In general, the automatization of business transactions has not lived up to the
expectations of its propagandists. This can be explained by some serious shortcomings
of existing approach like EDIFACT: It is a rather procedural and cumbersome standard,
making the programming of business transactions expensive, error prone and hard to
maintain. Finally, the exchange of business data via extranets is not integrated with
other document exchange processes, i.e., EDIFACT is an isolated standard.
