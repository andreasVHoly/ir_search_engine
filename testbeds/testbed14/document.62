3 Brief History Of The Methodologies
On the basis of the experience gathered in developing
the Enterprise Ontology [Usc95] and the TOVE
(TOronto Virtual Enterprise) project ontology [Grü95]
(both in the domain of enterprise modelling), the first
methodological outlines were proposed in 1995 and
later refined in [Usc96] and [UsG96]. At the 12th
European Conference for Artificial Intelligence
(ECAI’96) held in 1996, Bernaras et al. [Ber96]
presented a method used to build an ontology in the
domain of electrical networks as part of the Esprit
KACTUS project. METHONTOLOGY [Góm96]
appeared at the same time and was extended in later
papers [Fer97], [Góm98], [Fer99]. In 1997, that is, one
year later, a methodology was proposed for building
ontologies based on the SENSUS ontology [Swa97].
The methodology proposed by Uschold will be
described in section 5; Grüninger's methodology will be
discussed in section 6, the methodology proposed by
Bernaras et al. in section 7, METHONTOLOGY in
section 8, and finally, the SENSUS methodology in
section 9.
4 Criteria For Analysing Methodologies
The criteria that we have established for analysing each
methodology are:
C1. Inheritance from Knowledge Engineering.
Consideration of the influence of traditional
Knowledge Engineering on the methodology in
question.
C2. Detail of the methodology. Consideration of
whether the activities and techniques proposed by
the methodology are exactly specified.
C3. Recommendations for knowledge formalization.
Consideration of the formalism or
formalisms proposed for representing knowledge
(logic, frames, etc.).
C4. Strategy for building ontologies. Discussion of
which of the following strategies are used to
develop ontologies:
a. Application-dependent: the ontology is built
on the basis of an application knowledge base,
by means of a process of abstraction.
b. Application-semidependent: possible scenarios
of ontology use are identified in the
specification stage.
c. Application-independent: the process is
totally independent of the uses to which the
ontology will be put in knowledge-based
systems, agents, etc.
C5. Strategy for identifying concepts. The possible
strategies are [UsG96]: from the most concrete to
the most abstract (bottom-up), from the most
abstract to the most concrete (top-down), or from
the most relevant to the most abstract and most
concrete (middle-out).
C6. Recommended life cycle. Analysis of whether the
methodology implicitly or explicitly proposes a
life cycle.
C7. Differences between the methodology and IEEE
1074-1995. Discussion of which of the processes
and activities proposed by the IEEE standard
1074-1995 are not mentioned in the methodology.
C8. Recommended techniques. Specification of
whether particular techniques are proposed for
performing the different activities of which the
methodology is composed.
C9. What ontologies have been developed using the
methodology and what systems have been built
using these ontologies. The ontologies and
systems developed will be listed and briefly
described.
Criteria C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5 will show general
points of the methodologies. The other criteria will
show the maturity of each methodology. Another
interesting criterion for analysis would be collaborative
and distributive construction, that is, to what extent the
methodologies permit different groups at different sites
to work together to build ontologies; however, none of
the publications to date mention what each one contributes in this respect.
