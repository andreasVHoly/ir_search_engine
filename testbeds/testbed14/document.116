Biomedical information management applications involving text either retrieve documents or extract information. Enabling technologies include word-based statistical methods and semantic processing to identify concepts and relations. Although statistical methods provide considerable success, improvement is needed.
Semantic predications identified in MEDLINE1 citations on top of methodological search filters [1] increase the precision of retrieved citations [2]. For extracting information from text (concepts or relationships), statistical and pattern matching approaches have been attempted, but symbolic natural language processing has generally been more successful [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9] and [10].
In response to these considerations, a number of researchers in biomedical informatics are examining the use of natural language processing for a range of applications, including medical knowledge acquisition, medical literature indexing and searching, automatic coding of clinical text, and processing molecular biology information (see [11] and [12]). Providing high quality results (including semantic propositions) with accuracy in the general case remains a matter for investigation, however.
In this paper, we propose a detailed analysis of the hypernymic proposition in English, a structure which has not previously been the focus of extensive semantic interpretation methodologies. We investigate the processing of this structure as a way of improving a particular approach to semantic interpretation that supports enhanced access to biomedical documents and information. The hypernymic proposition involves two concepts that are in a taxonomic (‘ISA’) relationship, one semantically more specific, the hyponym, and the other more general, the hypernym. This is illustrated by the relationship between modafinil (hyponym) and stimulant (hypernym) in the sentence modafinil is a novel stimulant that is effective in the treatment of narcolepsy. This semantic structure appears frequently in scientific text and appears to function as a discourse phenomenon for accommodating the flow of new and old information.
Our proposal for identifying and interpreting hypernymic propositions is devised as an addition to a general knowledge-based semantic interpreter (called SemRep) that uses underspecified syntactic analysis and structured domain knowledge from the UMLS to identify semantic predications in biomedical text. SemRep has been used for processing coronary catheterization reports [13], extracting molecular biology information from the research literature [14] and [15], and identifying drug therapies in MEDLINE citations [16].
Currently, when interpreting the sentence above, SemRep identifies the semantic proposition “Stimulants TREATS Narcolepsy.” Although this is correct, it would be more useful to identify “Modafinil” (hyponym of “Stimulant”) as the semantic subject of TREATS in this sentence. The program discussed in this paper (called SemSpec) determines that “Modafinil” is a hyponym of “Stimulant” in this sentence and thus supplies the information that SemRep needs to provide the more precise semantic interpretation. These semantic propositions can potentially serve as MEDLINE indexing terms to support high-precision results from search queries such as “List all immunomodulators used to treat Crohn’s Disease.”
The research discussed here serves as a paradigm for investigating details of the interaction between domain knowledge and linguistic structure in natural language processing, and could also make a contribution to research on automatic processing of discourse structure and ontology engineering as well as information extraction in specific domains, such as pharmacology.
In the remainder of the paper, we first review research on natural language processing in the biomedical domain. Then, after introducing the permissible syntactic configurations encoding hypernymic propositions, we focus on the UMLS knowledge that supports the interpretation of these propositions and provide a brief overview of the SemRep approach to semantic interpretation. The Methods section concentrates on the SemSpec program. Finally, we describe a preliminary evaluation of the effectiveness of this processing and discuss improvements needed and directions for future work.
