Abstract
Conceptualising a domain has long been
recognised
as
a
prerequisite
for
understanding that domain and processing
information about it. Ontologies are
explicit specifications of conceptualisations
which are now recognised as important
components of information systems and
information processing. In this paper, we
describe a project in which ontologies are
part of the reasoning process used for
information management and for the
presentation
of
information.
Both
accessing and presenting information are
mediated via natural language and the
ontologies are coupled with the lexicon
used in the natural language component.
1 Introduction
Ontologies
are now being recognised as important
components
of
information
systems
and
information processing. It is commonly accepted
that an ontology is an
explicit specification of a
conceptualisation
(Gruber, 1995). In the areas of
knowledge representation and reasoning (KR) and
of conceptual modelling, it has long been
recognised that conceptualising a domain is a
prerequisite for understanding the domain and
processing
information
about
the
domain,
especially in the case of large, non-trivial domain
s.
Nowadays, there is no clear-cut border between
large and small domains, simply because
information systems are no longer isolated but are
parts of the
global information system
and need to
be
interoperable
. Hence, conceptualisations and
ontologies are required for all kinds of information 
systems and information processing. In some
cases it is not clear yet what functions and
advantages ontologies can offer, but there is no
doubt that in
every
case ontologies do offer
something: at the very least they offer a way to
address
meaning
of
terms
(
concepts
,
relations
)
required for information processing.
This paper attempts to provide some suggestions
on how natural language processing can benefit
from using ontologies. We present a large-scale
research project in which ontologies are part of th
e
reasoning
process
used
for
information
management
and
for the
presentation of
information. Users' access to information and the
presentation of information to users are both
mediated via natural language, and the ontologies
used in the reasoning component are coupled with
the lexicon used in the natural language
component.
In Section 2, we describe the FOCAL (Future
Operations Centre Analysis Laboratory) project:
both the ontological processing and the natural
language processing work presented here are based
on the relevant aspects of FOCAL. In Section 3,
we present ontology-related work for FOCAL and
in Section 4, the NLP-related aspects of FOCAL.
In Section 5, we show how ontologies and NLP are
combined. Section 6 summarises the current state
of this work and indicates directions for future
research.
