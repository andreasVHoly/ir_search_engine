Reduction to satisfiability
Just like propositional logic:
• A formula φ is satisfiable iff there is some interpretation I that satisfies φ (i.e.,
φ is true under I): I |= φ).
• Validity, equivalence, and entailment can be reduced to satisfiability:
• φ is a valid (i.e., a tautology) iff ¬φ is not satisfiable.
• φ is equivalent to ψ (φ ≡ ψ) iff φ ↔ ψ is valid.
• φ ≡ ψ iff φ |= ψ and ψ |= φ
• φ entails ψ (φ |= ψ) iff φ → ψ is valid (deduction theorem).
• φ |= ψ iff φ ∧ ¬ψ is not satisfiable .
• We need a sound and complete procedure deciding satisfiability: the tableaux
method is a decision procedure which checks the existence of a model.

Tableaux Calculus
Just like in propositional logic:
• The Tableaux Calculus is a decision procedure solving the problem of
satisfiability.
• If a formula is satisfiable, the procedure will constructively exhibit a model of
the formula.
• The basic idea is to incrementally build the model by looking at the formula,
by decomposing it in a top/down fashion. The procedure exhaustively looks at
all the possibilities, so that it can eventually prove that no model could be
found for unsatisfiable formulas.
With respect to propositional logic, the notion of model is different.

Tableaux Calculus
Finds a model for a given collection of sentences KB in negation normal form.
1. Consider the knowledge base KB as the root node of a refutation tree. A
node in a refutation tree is called tableaux.
2. Starting from the root, add new formulas to the tableaux, applying the
completion rules.
3. Completion rules are either deterministic – they yield a uniquely determined
successor node – or nondeterministic – yielding several possible alternative
successor nodes (branches).
4. Apply the completion rules until either
(a) an explicit contradiction due to the presence of two opposite ground
literals in a node (a clash) is generated in each branch, or
(b) there is a completed branch where no more rule is applicable (but. . .).

The Calculus
The completion rules for the propositional formulas:
φ ∧ ψ
φ
ψ
If a model satisfies a conjunction, then it also satisfies each of
the conjuncts
φ ∨ ψ
φ ψ
If a model satisfies a disjunction, then it also satisfies one of
the disjuncts. It is a non-deterministic rule, and it generates
two alternative branches of the tableaux.
(5/29)
The Calculus
The completion rules for quantified formulas:
∀x. φ
φ{X/t}
∀x. φ
If a model satisfies a universal quantified formula, the it also
satisfies the formula where the quantified variable has been
substituted with some term. The prescription is to use all the
terms which appear in the tableaux.
∃x. φ
φ{X/a}
If a model satisfies an existential quantified formula, then it also
satisfies the formula where the quantified variable has been
substituted with a fresh new skolem constant.
(6/29)
Models
• The completed branch of the refutation tree gives a model of KB: the KB is
satisfiable. Since all formulas have been reduced to ground literals (i.e., either
positive or negative atomic formulas which do not contain variables), it is
possible to find an interpretation to predicates using the constants, which
make all the sentences in the branch true.
• If there is no completed branch (i.e., every branch has a clash), then it is not
possible to find an interpretation for the predicates making the original KB
true: the KB is unsatisfiable. In fact, the original formulas from which the tree
is constructed can not be true simultaneously.
(7/29)
Negation Normal Form
The above set of completion rules work only if the formula has been translated
into Negation Normal Form, i.e., all the negations have been pushed down.
Example::
¬(∃x. [ ∀y. [ P(x) → Q(y) ] ])
becomes
∀x. [ ∃y. [ P(x) ∧ ¬Q(y) ] ]
(Why?)

Other Reasoning Problems
• Subsumption
• Γ |= P w Q
P and Q predicate symbols of the same arity
• P subsumes Q in Γ
• Γ |= ∀xˆ. [ Q(xˆ) → P(xˆ) ]
• Instance Checking
• The constant a is an instance of the unary predicate P
• Γ |= P(a)
(11/29)
Example
Given a theory Γ,
if PERSON w STUDENT in Γ
and if STUDENT(john) is valid in Γ
then PERSON(john) is valid in Γ
(12/29)
Subsumption
• Subsumption can be seen as a binary relation in the space of predicates with
same arity: P/n w Q/n.
• The subsumption relation is a partial ordering relation in the space of
predicates of same arity.
• Exercise: prove it.
• Hint: a partial ordering relation is a transitive, reflexive, and antisymmetric
relation.
