Numerous techniques have been developed to process natural language input. These techniques tend to be complicated and cumbersome. Often numerous passes through the input sentence(s) are required to fully parse the input, thereby adding to the time required to parse the input. Often the previous techniques do not have very robust feature checking capabilities. In particular, the techniques do not check for both syntactic and semantic compatibility. Often these techniques expend significant time trying to parse words that can be pruned or filtered according to their information.
The previous techniques of natural language processing are often limited to the performance of a particular purpose and cannot be used for other purposes. Conventional parsing techniques may be designed to function as part of a grammar checking system, but cannot function as part of a search engine, summarization application, or categorization application.
Furthermore, conventional parsing techniques do not take full advantage of an ontology as a lexical resource. This limits the versatility of the techniques.
The patent to Hemphill et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,984,178) discloses a chart parser designed to implement a probabilistic version of a unification-based grammar. The decision-making process occurs at intermediate parsing stages, and parse probabilities are considered before all parse paths have been pursued. Intermediate parse probability calculations have to be stored, and the system has to check for intermediate feature clashes.
