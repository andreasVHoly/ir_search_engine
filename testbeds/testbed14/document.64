We are confident that foundational ontologies will eventually improve communication
among agents in most cases of information exchange: information retrieval
and extraction, semantic web services, software requirement analysis and unified modeling process, control knowledge, etc. In fact, foundational ontologies can act as a reference for agents to commit to certain theories, as a set of formal guidelines for domain  modeling, and as a tool
for making heterogeneous ontologies interoperate or merge. According to the needs, an upper level ontology can be used either in a
light version, for computationally intensive applications, or as an off-the-shelf fully axiomatized theory, to be consulted as a reference source for more sporadic meaning negotiation purposes.
That is why we intended DOLCE to be as detailed and rigorous as possible, and yet we
plan to release a light-weight version.
In the light of this vision, we have started using DOLCE (or one of its
preliminary
versions) in several
projects, either as a
tool or a set of guidelines, with substantial
results in the creation of well-founded and useful ontologies (by the way,
there is
still
no benchmark or testbed for
ontology quality, since
there is
small
agreement on the
criteria to adopt, and we are suggesting some of them ...).
The
WordNet
experiment is one of the
research
applications of DOLCE,
already
presented in several contexts, which seems promising in bridging one of the multidisciplinary gaps in ontological engineering, between the domain of lexical technologies,
and that of conceptual modelling.
