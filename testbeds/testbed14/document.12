THE TABLEAU METHOD FOR TEMPORAL LOGIC:
AN OVERVIEW
Pierre WOLPER
Abstract: An overview of the tableau decision method for propositional
temporal logic is presented. The method is described in detail for
linear time temporal logic. It is then discussed how it can be applied to
other variants of temporal logic like branching time temporal logic and
extensions o f linear time temporal logic. Finally, applications o f
temporal logics to computer science are reviewed.
I. Introduction
Temporal logic (TL) has been studied as a branch of logic for
several decades. It was developed as a logical framework to formalize
reasoning about time, temporal relations such as before
and related concepts such as tenses. TL is closely related to the modal
logic of necessity ([HC68]) which attempts to formalize the notions of
possible and necessary truth. As temporal logic can in fact be viewed
asa special case of modal logic, its origins can also be traced to those
of that theory. Tableau decision procedures for temporal and modal
logic have been known for some time. An account of earlier work on
temporal logic can be found in either the book of Prior ([Pr67]) or of
Rescher and Urquhart ([RU711).
In [P677], it was suggested that temporal logic could be a useful tool
to formalize reasoning about the execution sequence of programs and
especially of concurrent programs. In that approach, the sequence of
states a machine goes through during a computation is viewed as the
temporal sequence of worlds described by TL. Since then, several
researchers have been using TL to state and prove properties of
concurrent programs (e.g. [GPSS801, [La80], [0L80], [BP80],
[MP8 I], [CES831, [MP83], [MW84]), protocols (e.g. [Ha80], [H081],
[SM81], [SM82], [Vo82], [SS82], [SMV83], [SPE841, and hardware
(e.g. [Bo821 , [M081], [HMM83], [Mo831).

In this paper, we first define the propositional version of linear time
temporal logic. We then describe the tableau decision procedure for
PTL. We also review other variants o f temporal logics and state
results about their decision problems. And finally, we discuss the use
of temporal logic in computer science.
