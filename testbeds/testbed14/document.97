Abstract.
Probabilistic Description Logics are the basis of ontologies
in the Semantic Web. Knowledge representation and reasoning for these
logics have been extensively explored in the last years; less attention has
been paid to techniques that learn ontologies from data. In this paper
we report on algorithms that learn probabilistic concepts and roles. We
present an initial effort towards semi-automated learning using probabilistic methods. We combine ILP (Inductive Logic Programming) methods and a probabilistic classifier algorithm (search for candidate hypotheses is conducted by a Noisy-OR classifier). Preliminary results on a real
world dataset are presented.
1 Introduction
Ontologies are key components of the Semantic Web, and among
the formalisms
proposed within Knowledge Engineering, the most popular ones at the moment
are based on Description Logics (DLs) [1]. There are however
relatively few
ontologies available, and on very few subjects. Moreover, building an ontology
from scratch can be a very burdensome and difficult task; very often two domain
experts design rather different ontologies for the same domain [2]. Considerable
effort is now invested into developing automated means for the acquisition of
ontologies. Most of the currently pursued approaches do not
use the expressive
power of languages such as OWL, and are only capable of learning ontologies of
restricted form, such as taxonomic hierarchies [3].
