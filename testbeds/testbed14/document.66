According to the vision introduced above, we do
not
intend DOLCE as a
candidate for
a “universal” standard ontology. Rather, it is intended to act as starting point
for
comparing and elucidating
the relationships with other
future modules of the library, and
also for clarifying the hidden assumptions underlying existing ontologies or linguistic
resources such as WordNet.
As reflected by its acronym, DOLCE has a clear
cognitive bias
, in the sense that it
aims at capturing the ontological
categories underlying natural language
and
human
commonsense. We believe that such bias is
very important for the Semantic Web
(especially if we recognize
its intrinsic social
nature [3]). We do
not commit to a
strictly referentialist metaphysics related to the intrinsic nature of the world: rather, the
categories we introduce here are thought of as cognitive artifacts
ultimately
depending
on human perception, cultural imprints
and
social conventions (a sort of
“cognitive”
metaphysics). We
draw
inspiration
here
from Searle’s
notion of
“deep background”
[18], which
represents
the set of skills,
tendencies
and
habits
shared by
humans because of
their peculiar
biological make
up,
and
their
evolved
ability to
interact
with
their ecological niches [9]. The
consequences of
this
approach are
that our
categories
are at
the
so-called
mesoscopic
level,
and
they do not claim any special robustness
against the state of the art in scientific
knowledge:
they
are
just
descriptive
notions
[21] that assist in making
already
formed
conceptualizations
explicit. They do not
provide therefore a
prescriptive
(or “revisionary”
[21, 15])
framework to conceptualize
entities. In other
words, our
categories
describe
entities in a post-hoc way,
reflecting
more ore less the surface structure of language and cognition.
DOLCE is an ontology of
particulars
, in the sense that
its
domain of discourse is
restricted to
them. The
fundamental
ontological distinction
between
universals
and
particulars
can be
informally
understood by
taking the relation of
instantiation
as a
primitive: particulars are entities which have no instances
2
; universals
are
entities that
do have
instances. Properties
and
relations
(corresponding to predicates in a
logical
language) are usually considered as
universals. We take the ontology of universals as
formally separated from
that of particulars. Of course, universals
do
appear in an ontology of particulars, insofar they 
are used to
organize
and characterize
them:
simply,
since they are not in the domain of discourse, they are not themselves subject to being
organized and characterized
(e.g., by means of
metaproperties
). An ontology of
unary
universals has been presented in [12]. In this paper, we shall occasionally use
notions
(e.g., rigidity) taken from such work in our meta-language
