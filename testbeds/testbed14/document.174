The tableaux algorithm is a general technique for deciding concept satisfiability problems
in description logics. It provides an algorithmic framework that is parametric
with respect to language constructors, and is useful for studying the correctness and complexity of concrete decision procedures as well as for designing practical implementations.
In practice highly optimized tableau-based algorithms have been implemented in DL inference engines. In the presence of inverse roles and number restrictions (corresponding to the ontology languages OWL-lite and OWL-DL respectively), however, most successful tableau-based DL reasoning systems exhibit problems, for example, degraded performance. The current loss of performance is largely due to the missing applicability of some well-known optimization techniques, especially the one for caching the satisfiability status of modal successors, and the new absorption technique
which transforms GCIs into unfoldable axioms by considering the Ramsey-rule [Ram31] for a role and its inverse. For more discussions please see next subsection.
Our research initially started from carrying out a thorough investigation of the current status (about which techniques become invalid or less efficient) and performing an in-depth cause-analysis (of why current techniques for inverse roles and number restrictions are inefficient). During the course of this research, we have found and proposed several new techniques (including an equivalence about inverse relations, the elimination of inverse roles, and the sound global tableaux caching technique) as solutions. For number restrictions, an algebraic method was proposed in [HM01a]
for SHQ and was implemented in the DL reasoner RACER [HM01b]. It is known from practice that the algebraic method has a good run-time performance. However, there was no theoretical explanation for this, thus it is questionable if the algebraic method is better than other approaches. Indeed in [Tob01] a question was raised about whether a tableau-based approach could lead to an optimal decision procedure for concept satisfiability tests of number restrictions. It was also unclear about how
to use the algebraic method for DLs having number restrictions and inverse roles. 
These questions are answered in this report.
