With its tighter integration with RDF
and RDFS, DAML+OIL was the
first Description Logic-inspired language to be completely integrated into the
fabric of the Semantic Web (as it was then defined). There was, however,
no formal semantic integration of DAML+OIL with RDF and RDFS , as RDF and
RDFS did not have a formal semantics at the time when DAML+OIL
was being developed. DAML+OIL also lacked any formal
status, having been the product of a group of researchers operating under
the auspices of the so-called “Joint EU/US ad hoc Agent Markup Language
Committee”. This group published DAML+OIL as a W3C Note on December 18, 2001 (see http://www.w3.org/Submission/2001/12/).
To fix these problems, the W3C chartered two working groups in 2001. The RDF Core Working Group was to be responsible for updating the RDF
recommendation and providing a formal semantics for RDF and thus for the
Semantic Web. The Web Ontology Working Group was to be responsible for
designing an ontology language for the web, compatible with the new version
of RDF. The Web Ontology Working Group developed the Web Ontology Language OWL [ Bechhofer et al., 2004], which became a W3C recommendation on 10 February 2004 (see http://www.w3.org/2004/OWL/).
In parallel, the RDF Core Working Group developed a formal semantics for RDF and RDFS [Hayes, 2004].
The OWL recommendation defines a family of three languages in order
to address concerns ranging from level of expressiveness to degree of compatibility with RDF. Two of these so-called “species” of OWL, OWL Full
and OWL DL, provide the same set of Description Logic constructors, but
differ in the way the constructors can be used: in OWL Full they can be
used in arbitrary
RDF
graphs, whereas in OWL DL their use is restricted
so that OWL DL ontologies correspond directly to Description Logic knowledge bases. The third species of OWL, OWL Lite, is very similar to OWL
DL, but provides a reduced set of constructors.
