Research client deliverables have evolved from bare bones tables to the current dominant approach of sharing insights via PowerPoint. The search continues for a powerful and more flexible medium to deliver research results and insights to newly data hungry enterprises.

This by no means indicates that PowerPoint is going to go out quietly into the night – it will remain the dominant standard in the near future, but the quest for a more elegant delivery mechanism remains. Companies now understand the value of data more than ever. In the age of Big Data, there’s pressure to get to big insights at the speed of light. This need to see meaning in data and the ability to get instant gratification from the data at hand will only grow. That’s a race we need to be prepared for.

Every so often in a conversation with our research clients on reporting or dashboards the name Tableau pops up. In most cases, these requests have been driven by enterprise research buyers and research companies don’t really understand how to cope with them.

If you’re not familiar with Tableau, here are five reasons you should be:

The Future Currency in the Enterprise
Tableau certainly is the most dominant do-it-yourself (DIY) business intelligence (BI) tool currently available in the market. My bet is that in the next five years it will cement itself as a standard for data visualization and reporting in the enterprise. So far, companies have been happy with spreadsheets and limited reporting capabilities, but with the burgeoning amount of data that’s generated by even smaller firms, it’s become imperative that a more sustainable data exploration and visualization solution fill that gap. Tableau fits in perfectly.

Beautiful Visualizations
Tableau at its heart is a data visualization tool. Its ability to tell stories with stunningly simple visualizations is what makes it unique. The blend of power with beauty and simplicity is what attracts first timers to Tableau. For those who haven’t yet experienced Tableau’s visualization capabilities visit the visual gallery here.  

Need IT? No Thank You
This is where Tableau really sets itself apart from other BI tools. You can go from novice to expert without IT assistance. Tableau Desktop is a simple authoring tool for creating your reports – you can download, install and connect to your data sources with little to no IT assistance. It allows you to leverage the power of Tableau with zero IT involvement.

Fast Learning Curve
Tableau is easy enough for anyone with intermediate Excel skills to pick up and allows you to play with much larger data sets at lightning-fast speeds. The familiar drag –and-drop interface makes it incredibly familiar to Excel users and the visualization options are abundant. With a little bit of patience and Google, anyone can pick up Tableau relatively quickly.

Handles Large Amounts of Data
Though simple, Tableau has the ability to crank out reports on extremely large data sets without drastically affecting performance. Support for native SPSS, Excel and big data sources is already present in Tableau. Tableau can connect to live data sources and feed enterprise users real-time results on key business metrics.

We believe that enterprises will continue to grow and derive value by employing analysts and data scientists to dig into the growing treasure trove of data, and that Tableau has the potential to become the central point of business intelligence for the enterprise. The question is: Will research firms play nice with enterprise BI systems like Tableau? We sure hope they do.
