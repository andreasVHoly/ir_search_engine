3.3 Methontology Methodology
This methodology will give the construction of ontology at knowledge level. The ontology
development process is: 1) Determine the tasks to be performed when building ontology i.e.
scheduling, control, quality assurance, specification, knowledge acquisition, conceptualization,
integration, formalization, implementation, evaluation, maintenance, documentation and
configuration management. 2) Determine the life cycle of ontology as number of stages. This
represents the activities to be performed in each stage and how the stages are related. 3)
Determine the techniques used in each activity, the products that each activity output and how
they have to be evaluated [1][2]. These methodologies deal with software engineering concepts. It
handles all the activities in details.
3.4 Sensus Methodology
The method based on Sensus is a top-down approach for deriving domain specific ontologies
from huge ontologies. The steps are: 1) A series of terms are taken as seed. 2) These seed terms
are linked by hand to SENSUS. 3) All the concepts in the path from the seed terms to the root of
SENSUS are included. 4) Terms that could be relevant within the domain and have not yet
appeared are added. 5) Finally, for those nodes that have a large number of paths through them,
the entire subtree under the node is sometimes added, based on the idea that if many of the nodes
in a subtree have been found to be relevant, then the other nodes in the subtree are likely to be
relevant as well [2]. This methodology uses the existing ontology, where the merging will be
complex due to different structures.
