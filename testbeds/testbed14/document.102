During the kick-off and refinement phase one might distinguish in general two concurrent approaches for modeling, in
particular for
knowledge extraction
from relevant knowledge sources: top-down and bottom-up. In a
top-down approach for modeling the domain one starts by modeling
concepts and relationships on a very generic level. Subsequently these items are refined. This approach is typically
done manually and leads to a high-quality engineered ontology.  Available top-level ontologies may here be reused
and serve as a starting point to develop new ontologies.
In our example scenrio we encountered a middle-out approach, i.e. to identify the most important concepts which
will then be used to obtain the remainder of the hierarchy by generalization and specialization.  However, with
the support of an automatic document analysis, a typical
bottom-up
-approach may be applied. There, relevant concepts are extracted semi-automatically from available documents. Based on the assumption that most concepts and
conceptual structures of the domain as well the company terminology are described in documents, applying knowledge
acquisition from text for ontology design helps building ontologies automatically.

To
formalize
the initial semi-formal description of the ontology ontology engineers firstly form a taxonomy out of the
semi-formal description of the ontology and add relations
other than the “is-a” relation which forms the taxonomical
structure.
