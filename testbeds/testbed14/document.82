Ontologies are concerned with the 
meaning
of 
terms. It is therefore appropriate when selecting 
an 
ontological language
to choose a language which 
is equipped with a formal semantics. This 
requirement excludes XML from the list of 
possible candidates, as XML does not offer 
semantics, but only syntax. RDF provides some 
semantics, but proper, formal semantics requires 
languages based on logics. Description logics 
(DL) provide some frameworks, and several 
languages used for building and processing 
ontologies are DL-based, e.g. DAML and 
DAML+OIL languages, including such languages 
as SHF and SHIQ, and the OWL language 
(Horrocks et al., 2003). 
A commonly used view of an architecture for 
the Semantic Web is a layered architecture, with 
XML as the bottom layer, RDF as the middle 
layer, and logic (e.g. DL) as the top layer 
(sometimes the top layer distinguishes ontological 
vocabulary, logic, proof; on top of the logic layer 
a trust layer is sometimes placed). The logic layer 
is a necessary component if the Semantic Web is to 
be equipped with a formal semantics; this logic 
layer can be based on a description logic (such as 
SHIQ or OWL), on first-order logics, KIF or 
CycL, and whichever logic is used determines the 
expressibility and tractability of the framework, 
but in every case a formal semantics is added. 
Frameworks based on DL (description logics) are 
most successful, because they provide expressive 
languages with practical tractability. SHIQ is one
such language, another is the closely related 
language OWL 
The ontological language chosen for FOCAL is 
SHIQ, a DL language of the DAML+OIL project 
(
http://www.daml.org/
), a successor of the OIL 
project 
(
http://www.ontoknowledge,org/oil/
). 
FaCT (
http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~horrocks/FaCT/
) 
is a reasoner for the SHIQ logic employed in the 
OilEd ontology editor (
http://oiled.man.ac.uk/
). 
The logic SHIQ has also been implemented in the 
(
www.cs.concordia.ca/~faculty/haarslev/racer/
) 
RACER project. 
SHIQ is closely related to OWL (Horrocks et 
al., 2003). In fact, there are a few variants of 
OWL, namely OWL Lite, OWL DL and OWL 
Full. OWL Lite is similar to a description logic 
SHIF(D), while OWL DL is similar to a 
description logic SHOIN(D). The language 
implemented in the RACER framework is a 
version 
of 
SHIQ, 
which 
provides 
some 
functionalities for dealing with individuals, and 
dealing with concrete domains; this makes the 
RACER’s version of SHIQ very close to OWL 
Lite. A proper discussion on these languages is 
beyond the scope of the paper, but clearly the 
RACER language is an implemented language and 
reasoner for a logic very close to OWL DL.
