Abstract. This paper provides a self-contained first introduction to description logics
(DLs). The main concepts and features are explained with examples before syntax
and semantics of the DL SROIQ are defined in detail. Additional sections review
lightweight DL languages, discuss the relationship to the OWL Web Ontology
Language and give pointers to further reading.
Introduction
Description logics (DLs) are a family of knowledge representation languages that are
widely used in ontological modelling. An important practical reason for this is that they
provide one of the main underpinnings for the OWL Web Ontology Language as standardised
by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). However, DLs have been used in
knowledge representation long before the advent of ontological modelling in the context
of the Semantic Web, tracing back to first DL modelling languages in the mid 1980s.
As their name suggests, DLs are logics (in fact most DLs are decidable fragments
of first-order logic), and as such they are equipped with a formal semantics: a precise
specification of the meaning of DL ontologies. This formal semantics allows humans and
computer systems to exchange DL ontologies without ambiguity as to their meaning, and
also makes it possible to use logical deduction to infer additional information from the
facts stated explicitly in an ontology – an important feature that distinguishes DLs from
other modelling languages such as UML.
The capability of inferring additional knowledge increases the modelling power of
DLs but it also requires some understanding on the side of the modeller and, above all,
good tool support for computing the conclusions. The computation of inferences is called
reasoning and an important goal of DL language design has been to ensure that reasoning
algorithms of good performance are available. This is one of the reasons why there is not
just a single description logic: the best balance between expressivity of the language and
complexity of reasoning depends on the intended application.
In this paper we provide a self-contained first introduction to description logics. We
start by explaining the basic way in which knowledge is modelled in DLs in Section 1
and continue with an intuitive introduction to the most important DL modelling features
in Section 2. This leads us to the rather expressive DL called SROIQ, the syntax of
which we summarise in Section 3. In Section 4, we explain the underlying ideas of DL

semantics and use it to define the meaning of SROIQ ontologies. Many DLs can be
obtained by omitting some features of SROIQ and in Section 5 we review some of the
most important DLs obtained in this way. In particular, this includes various lightweight
description logics that allow for particularly efficient reasoning. In Section 6 we discuss
the relationship of DLs to the OWL Web Ontology Language. We conclude with pointers
to further reading in Section 7.
