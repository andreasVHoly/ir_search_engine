A bottom-up approach results in a very high 
level of detail. This in turn (1) increases overall effort,
(2) makes it difficult to spot commonality
between related concepts, and (3) increases risk of inconsistencies
which leads in turn to (4) re-work and yet more effort.
A top-down approach results in better control of the level of detail, however starting at the top
can result in choosing and imposing arbitrary high level categories. Because these are not naturally
arising, there is a risk of less stability
in the model which in turn leads to re-work and greater effort. This is contrasted against a top-down approach which uses a more general top define concept.
The emphasis on dividing up rather than putting together also results, for a different reason, in
missing the commonality inherent in the complex web of inter-connected concepts.
A middle-out approach, by contrast, strikes a balance in terms of the level detail. Detail only
arises as necessary, by specialising the basic concepts, so some effort is avoided. By starting with
most important concepts with the most important concepts 
first, and defining higher level concepts
in terms of these, the higher level categories naturally arise and thus are more likely to be stable.
This, in turn, leads to less re-work and less overall effort.
