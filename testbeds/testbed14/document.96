Abstract.
This chapter investigates NLP techniques for ontology population, using a combination of rule-based approaches and machine learning. We describe a method for
term recognition using linguistic and statistical techniques, making use of contextual information to bootstrap learning. We then investigate how term recognition
techniques can be useful for the wider task of information extraction, making use
of similarity metrics and contextual information. We describe two tools we have
developed which make use of contextual information to help the development of
rules for named entity recognition. Finally, we evaluate our ontology-based information extraction results using a novel technique we have developed which makes
use of similarity-based metrics first developed for term recognition.

1. Introduction
In semantic web applications, ontology development and population are tasks of
paramount importance. The manual performance of these tasks is labour- and therefore
cost-intensive, and would profit from a maximum level of automation. For this purpose,
the identification and extraction of terms that play an important role in the domain under
consideration, is a vital first step.
Automatic term recognition (also known as term extraction) is a crucial component
of many knowledge-based applications such as automatic indexing, knowledge discovery, terminology mining and monitoring, knowledge management and so on. It is particularly important in the healthcare and biomedical domains, where new terms are emerging
constantly.
