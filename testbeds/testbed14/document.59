Introduction

In this paper I present a general introduction to natural language processing. This is primarily a discussion of how one might go about getting a computer to process a natural language. I also describe how PT-Thinker appears to process English.

"Natural language processing" here refers to the use and ability of systems to process sentences in a natural language such as English, rather than in a specialized artificial computer language such as C++. The systems of real interest here are digital computers of the type we think of as personal computers and mainframes (and not digital computers in the sense in which "we are all digital computers," if this is even true). Of course humans can process natural languages, but for us the question is whether digital computers can or ever will process natural languages.

Unfortunately there is some confusion in the use of terms, and we need to get straight on this before proceeding. First of all, occasionally the phrase "natural language" is used not for actual languages as they are used in ordinary discourse, such as our actual use of English to communicate in everyday life, but for a more restricted subset of such a human language, one purged of constructions and ambiguities that computers could not sort out. Hence one writer states that "human languages allow anomalies that natural languages cannot allow."2 There may be a need for such a language, but a natural language restricted in this way is artificial, not natural. I do not use the phrase "natural language" in this restricted sense of an artificial natural language. When I use the phrase, I mean human language in all its messiness and varied use.

Second, the phrase "natural language processing" is not always used in the same way. There is a broad sense and a narrow sense.1 The phrase sometimes is taken broadly to include signal processing or speech recognition, context reference issues, and discourse planning and generation, as well as syntactic and semantic analysis and processing (the meaning of these terms will be discussed more fully later). At other times the phrase is used more narrowly to include only syntactic and semantic analysis and processing.

Third, even if this confusion is overcome, the phrase "natural language processing" may or may not be taken as synonymous with "natural language understanding." "Processing" most naturally is used for both interpretation and generation, while one would think "understanding" is better used for only the interpretation part. To me, to say that a system is capable of natural language understanding does not imply that the system can generate natural language, only that it can interpret natural language. To say that the system can process natural language allows for both understanding (interpretation) and generation (production). But the phrase "natural language understanding" seems used by some authors as synonymous with "natural language processing," and on this use includes interpretation and generation. In this paper I�ll use the phrase natural language processing, but keep in mind I�m mostly just discussing interpretation rather than generation.

Fourth, another problem is that the phrase "natural language understanding" is sometimes used in the sense of research into how natural languages work and the attempt to develop a computational model of this working, with "natural language processing" referring to a system interpreting and generating natural languages. This use of the phrase alludes to two distinct goals of this field of research. One goal is to understand how natural language processing works; here "natural language understanding" is a human endeavor to understand natural language processing, whoever does the processing. Another goal is to get a computer to process natural languages, and of course in this attempt to build a natural language processor fulfilling the first goal of understanding how a processor works could be useful. Another way to distinguish these two goals is to note that in seeking to develop a computational model of natural language processing (or understanding), one must distinguish between the scientific goal and the technical goal. In this attempt to develop a computational model, there is the scientific goal or motivation of understanding natural language comprehension and production for its own sake. There is also usually associated the technical goal of getting a computer to process natural language sentences.3 Allen at first seems to distinguish natural language understanding as a human scientific endeavor from natural language processing as something that endeavor is trying to investigate and model, but then at times even he uses "natural language understanding" in a way that requires one to figure out which sense is intended.

There is a fifth confusion to sort out, and this is that the term "understanding" is loaded with implications or connotations that aren�t present with "processing," though most users of the phrase "natural language understanding" seem either unaware or unconcerned about these loaded connotations. Humans are of course able to process and understand natural languages, but the real interest in natural language processing here is in whether a computer can or will be able to do it. Because of the connotations of the term "understanding," it�s use in the context of computer processing should be qualified or explained. Searle, for example, claims that digital computers such as PCs and mainframes, as we currently know them, cannot understanding anything at all, and no future such digital computer will ever be able to understand anything by virtue of computation alone. Others disagree. In view of this controversy over whether digital computers of the type under consideration can ever understand anything, use of the phrase "natural language understanding" seems to slant the issue unless one qualifies the use of the phrase "understanding." But many authors use the phrase "understanding" as if the term had no controversial history with respect to computers. I think that Searle�s claims, whether correct or not, are significant and need to be addressed, and one shouldn�t go slinging around the term "understanding" without noting that it is not necessarily implied that computers can understand in the sense to which Searle objects. The term "processing" is perhaps preferable to "understanding" in this context, but "understanding" has a history here and I am not advocating we discontinue use of the term. Certainly in this paper if I use the terms "understanding" or "knowledge" metaphorically with reference to computers, I imply nothing about whether they can or will ever really understand or know in any philosophically interesting sense.
