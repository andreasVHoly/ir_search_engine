Ontology Engineering Methodology
Summary. In this chapter we present a methodology for introducing and maintaining
ontology based knowledge management applications into enterprises with a
focus on Knowledge Processes and Knowledge Meta Processes. While the former
process circles around the usage of ontologies, the latter process guides their initial
set up. We illustrate our methodology by an example from a case study on skills
management. The methodology serves as a scaffold for Part B “Ontology Engineering”
of the handbook. It shows where more specific concerns of ontology engineering
find their place and how they are related in the overall process.
1 Introduction
Ontologies constitute valuable assets that are slowly, but continuously gaining
recognition and use throughout a set of disciplines – as becomes visible in
Part C of this book. Ontologies frequently being a complex asset, their creation
and management does neither come by coincidence nor does it come for free.
Rather, the objectives pursued with their development as well as the development
itself must be critically assessed by the organization or – rarely – the
individual who is pushing for their creation and maintenance. The discipline
that investigates the principles, methods and tools for initiating, developing
and maintaining ontologies is “ontology engineering” which is the topic of
this part of the handbook. “Ontology engineering methodology” as a part of
ontology engineering deals with the process and methodological aspects of ontology
engineering, i.e. with the issues of how to provide guidelines and advice
to (potential) developers of ontologies.
It is the purpose of this chapter to introduce a rather generic ontology engineering
methodology to the reader and to indicate where this methodology
links to more specific topics discussed mostly, but obviously not completely,
in the remainder of part B of this handbook. Such as software engineering
methodologies cannot be described in isolation from actual software

engineering activities, the purpose of ontology engineering methodologies can
only be understood in the context of actual ontology engineering experiences.
The methodology presented here, has been derived from several case studies
of building and using ontologies in the realm of knowledge management.
Knowledge management deals with the thorough and systematic management
of knowledge within an enterprise and between several cooperating
enterprises. Knowledge management is a major issue for human resource
management, enterprise organization and enterprise culture – nevertheless,
information technology (IT) constitutes a crucial enabler for many aspects of
knowledge management and ontologies frequently turn out to be valuable assets
for knowledge management in order to target core knowledge management
issues such as search, information integration, or mapping of knowledge assets.
As a consequence, knowledge management is an inherently interdisciplinary
subject and ontologies used for knowledge management play a central role, but
at the same time they are by no means the single factor to determine success
or failure of the overall system. Thus, we may derive our rationale that the
objective of knowledge management constitutes a typical, yet comprehensive
blueprint for issues that arise when developing complex ontologies. Therefore,
we have chosen the knowledge management setting described below in order
to report on a generic ontology engineering methodology.
IT-supported KM solutions are frequently built around some kind of organizational
memory [1] that integrates informal, semi-formal and formal knowledge
in order to facilitate its access, sharing and reuse by members of the
organization(s) for solving their individual or collective tasks [7]. In such a
context, knowledge has to be modelled, appropriately structured and interlinked
for supporting its flexible integration and its personalized presentation
to the consumer. Ontologies may provide such structuring and modeling of
problems by providing a formal conceptualization of a particular domain that
is shared by a group of people in an organization [14,22].
There exist various proposals for methodologies that support the systematic
introduction of KM solutions into enterprises and with it the construction
of ontologies. A classical approach for introducing knowledge management
systems – including ontologies – is CommonKADS that puts emphasis on an
early feasibility study as well as on constructing several models that capture
different kinds of knowledge needed for realizing a KM solution [26].
Re-engineering earlier approaches, we found that methodologies must distinguish
two processes in order to achieve a clear identification of issues [27]:
whereas the first process addresses aspects of introducing a new ontology based
system into an organization as well as maintaining it (the so-called
“Knowledge Meta Process”), the second process addresses the management
of knowledge using the developed ontology (or ontologies), i.e. the so-called
“Knowledge Process” (see Fig. 1). E.g. in the approach described in [25],
one may recognize the intermingling of the two aspects from the different
roles that, e.g. “knowledge identification” and “knowledge creation” play.
