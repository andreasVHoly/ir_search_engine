Criteria For
Analysing Methodologies
The criteria that we have established for
analysing each
methodology are:
C1.
Inheritance
from
Knowledge
Engineer
ing
.
Consideration
of
the
influence
of
traditional
Knowledge Engineering
on
the methodology
in
question.
C2.
Detail
of the
methodology
. Consideration
of
whether the activities and techniques proposed by
the methodology are exactly specified.
C3.
Recommendations
for
knowledge
formalization
.
Consideration
of
the
formalism
or
formalisms proposed for representing knowledge
(logic, frames, etc.).
C4.
Strategy
for building ontologies
. Discussion of
which
of the
following
strategies
are
used
to
develop ontologies:
a.
Application-dependent
: the ontology is built
on the basis of an application knowledge base,
by means of a process
of abstraction.
b.
Application semidependent
:
possible
scenarios of ontology use are identified
in
the
specification stage.
c.
Application-independent
: the
process
is
totally independent of the uses to
which the
ontology
will
be
put in knowledge-based
systems, agents, etc.
C5.
Strategy
for identifying concepts
. The possible
strategies are [UsG96
]
: from
the most concrete to
the
most abstract (bottom-up), from
the
most
abstract to the most concrete (top-down), or from
the most relevant to the most abstract and most
concrete (middle-out).
C6.
Recommend
ed life cycle
. Analysis of whether the
methodology
implicitly
or explicitly
proposes a
life cycle.
C7.
Differences between the methodology and
IEEE
107
4-1995
. Discussion of which of the processes
and
activities
proposed by
the
IEEE
standard
1074
-1995
are not mentioned in the methodology.
C8.
Recommended
techniques
.
Specification
of
whether particular techniques are
proposed
for
performing
the different activities of which
the
methodology is composed.
C9.
What ontologies have been developed using the
methodology and
what systems have been built
using
these
ontologies
.
The
ontologies
and
systems
develop
ed
will
be
listed
and briefly
described
