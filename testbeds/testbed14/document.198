The first major effort to build a language that combined Description Logics
and the Semantic Web was OIL (the Ontology Inference Layer) [Horrocks et al., 2000a], a part of the On-To-Knowledge research project funded by the European Union. As it was one of the first and with all first versions, there were numerous problems exhibited.
The OIL language was explicitly designed as “a web- 
based representation and inference language for ontologies [combining] the
widely used modeling primitives from frame-based languages with the formal
semantics and reasoning services provided by description logics” (http://www.ontoknowledge.org/oil/oilhome.shtml).
Description Logics provide the semantics for OIL, so much so that the
semantics of OIL is specified via a mapping to the Description Logic
SHIQ [Fensel et al., 2001; Horrocks et al., 1999].
OIL has a syntax based on the Resource Description Framework (RDF), as well as an XML syntax, that
provided the connection to the Semantic Web of the time. 3 OIL allows the
grouping of Description Logic constructs in a way similar to frame systems,
providing a more intuitive feel to the language as opposed to the logically
inspired syntax usually used for Description Logics. These three influences—
Description Logics, frames, and the Semantic Web—are present not only in
OIL, but also in all of its successors.
