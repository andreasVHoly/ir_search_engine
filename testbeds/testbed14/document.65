2.1 Enduring and perduring entities
DOLCE is based on a fundamental distinction between
enduring
and
perduring
entities, i.e.
between
what philosophers usually call
continuants
and
occurrents
[19], a
distinction still strongly
debated
both in the philosophical
literature [22]
and
within
ontology
standardization
initiatives
3
. Again, we must emphasise that this distinction
is motivated by our cognitive bias: we do not commit to the fact that both these
kinds
of entity “really exist”,
and we are
indeed
sympathetic with the
recent
proposal
made
by Peter Simons, that enduring entities can be seen as equivalence classes of
perduring
entities, as the result of some kind of abstraction mechanism [20].
The difference between enduring
and perduring entities
(which we shall
also call
endurants 
and
perdurants
) is related to
their behavior in
time.
Endurants
are
wholly
present (i.e., all their proper parts are present) at any time they are present. Perdurants, on
the other hand, just
extend in
time by accumulating
different
temporal parts, so
that,
at any time they are present, they are only
partially
present, in the sense that some of
their proper temporal parts (e.g., their previous or future phases) may be
not
present.
E.g., the piece of paper you
are reading
now is wholly present, while some
temporal
parts of your
reading are
not
present any more. Philosophers say that
endurants are
entities that
are in time
, while lacking
however
temporal parts (so to speak, all
their
parts flow with them in time). Perdurants, on the other
hand,
are
entities that
happen
in time
, and can have temporal parts (all their parts are fixed in time)
4
.
Hence endurants and perdurants can be characterised by whether or
not they
can exhibit change in time. Endurants can “genuinely” change in time, in the
sense that the
very same
endurant as a
whole
can have
incompatible properties at
different
times;
perdurants cannot change in
this sense, since none of their parts
keeps
its identity in
time. To see this, suppose that an endurant has a property at a time
t
, and a different,
incompatible property at time
t':
in both
cases we
refer to
the whole object, without
picking up any particular part. On the other hand, when we say that a
perdurant
has a
property at
t
, and an
incompatible property at
t'
, there
are
always two
different
parts
exhibiting the two properties.
The main relation between endurants
and
perdurants is
that of
participation
: an endurant “lives” in time by
participating
in a perdurant. For example, a person, which is
an endurant, may participate in a discussion, which is a
perdurant. A person’s
life is
also a perdurant, in which a person participates throughout its all duration.
In the following, we shall take the term
occurrence
as synonym of
perdurant
. We
prefer this choice to the more common
occurrent
, which we reserve for denoting a type
(a
universal
), whose instances are occurrences (
particulars
).
