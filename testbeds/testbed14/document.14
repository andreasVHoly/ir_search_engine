tableau algorithms for Description Logic and
thorough complexity analysis
Schmidt-Schauß and Smolka describe the first complete (tableau-based)
subsumption algorithm for a non-trivial DL;
ALC: propositionally closed (negation, disjunction, existential restrictions);
complexity result: subsumption in ALC is PSPACE-complete.

algorithms and systems for very expressive Description Logic
(e.g., without finite model property)
Decidability results for very expressive Description Logic by translation into PDL
(propositional dynamic logic) (Uni Roma I), strong complexity results;
motivated by database applications.
Intensive optimization of tableau algorithms (Uni Manchester, IRST Trento,
Bell Labs): very efficient systems for expressive Description Logic.
Design of practical tableau algorithms for very expressive DLs
(Uni Manchester, RWTH Aachen).

Complexity: satisfiability/subsumption in ALC with transitive roles
and role hierarchies is EXPTIME-complete (translation into PDL).
The tableau algorithm can handle role hierarchies by replacing
the condition "r(x,y) in A" by "s(x,y) in A for a sub-role s of r".
The tableau algorithm can handle transitive roles by an additional rule:
if ∀ r . D(x) and r(x,y) is in A and r is transitive, then add ∀ r . D(y).
Both ideas must be combined; blocking required for termination.
