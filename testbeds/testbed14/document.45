Table (furniture)
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Structure of a prototypical table, resembling a Parsons table design
A table is a form of furniture with a flat horizontal upper surface used to support objects, for storage, show, and/or manipulation.[1] Some common types of table are the dining room table, which is used for seated persons to eat meals; the coffee table, which is a low table used in living rooms to display items or serve refreshments; and the bedside table, which is used to place an alarm clock and a lamp. Another common type of table is a desk, which is typically used to hold items that one would need to do work, such as papers, textbook, or computers. The surface must be held stable. For reasons of simplicity, this is usually done by support from below by either a column, a "base", or at least three columnar "stands". In special situations, table surfaces may be supported from a nearby wall, or suspended from above.

Common design elements include:

top surfaces of various shapes, including rectangular, square, rounded or semi-circular
legs arranged in two or more similar pairs. It usually has four legs.
several geometries of folding table that can be collapsed into a smaller volume (e.g., a TV tray, which is a portable, folding table on a stand)
heights ranging up and down from the most common 18–30 inches (46–76 cm) range, often reflecting the height of chairs or bar stools used as seating for people making use of a table, as for eating or performing various manipulations of objects resting on a table
presence or absence of drawers, shelves or other areas for storing items
expansion of the table surface by insertion of leaves or locking hinged drop leaf sections into a horizontal position (this is particularly common for dining tables)
Desks are tables specifically intended for information-manipulation tasks, including writing and use of interactive electronics such as desktop computers. Desks are used in offices, schools and in private homes, either in a home-office, a den, or in a children's room.

etymology[edit]
	Look up table in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.
The term table is derived from a merger of French table and Old English tabele, both ultimately from the Latin word tabula, "a board, plank, flat top piece". In Late Latin, tabula took over the meaning previously reserved to mensa (preserved in Spanish and Portuguese mesa "table"). In Old English, the word was bord, replaced by table for this meaning.[2]

Shape, height, and function[edit]
Tables come in a wide variety of materials, shapes, and heights dependent upon their origin, style, and intended use. Many tables are made from wood or wood-based products, although glass tables are also used. Most tables are composed of a flat surface and a base with one or more supports (legs). A table with a single, central foot is a pedestal table. Long tables often have extra legs for support.

Table tops can be in virtually any shape, although rectangular, square, round (e.g. the round table), and oval tops are the most frequent. Others have higher surfaces for personal use while either standing or sitting on a tall stool.

Many tables have tops that can be adjusted to change their height, position, shape, or size, either with foldable, sliding or extensions parts that can alter the shape of the top. Some tables are entirely foldable for easy transportation, e.g. camping. Small tables in trains and aircraft may be fixed or foldable, although they are sometimes considered as simply convenient shelves rather than tables.

Tables can be freestanding or designed for placement against a wall. Tables designed to be placed against a wall are known as console tables (French: console, "support bracket") and may be bracket-mounted (traditionally), like a shelf, or have legs, which sometimes imitate the look of a bracket-mounted table.
