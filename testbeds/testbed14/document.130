I﻿n the recent past, complex markets
have been characterized by a huge specialization of work, a high level of
outsourcing processes, and a more open
Porter’s chain that develop and increase
the needs of intra- and interorganizational
networks. Both intraorganizational networks among strategic units, divisions,
groups, and other even smaller substructures and interorganizational networks,
such as industrial districts and knowledge
networks (Hamel & Prahalad, 1990) are

composed of a constellation of specialized units (Ashby; 1956; Numagami, Ohta
& Nonaka, 1989), which might not be
controlled totally by a unique subject and
might grow and differentiate their activities, their system of artifacts, and their view
of the world in an autonomous way. Although every unit uses a different view of
the world (i.e., different
conceptualizations), they should coexist as
in a biofunctional system (Maturana &
Varela, 1980) and communicate, coordinate, and share knowledge in a networked
environment. Furthermore, this continuous
and unpredictable encountering of different views might enable the creation of an
unexpected and innovative combination of
processes and products (Chandler, 1962).
Most of these processes are based
nowadays on the Web, and in this scenario, tools and technologies that sustain
knowledge telecommunication, coordination, and sharing are increasing their importance. Therefore, both the scientific
community on computer science and industries are interested in what is called the
Semantic Web. The Semantic Web community has grown in terms of dimension
and specialization, and different viewpoints
of creating and managing semantic tools
have been taken on the nature of the Web.
In studies, an excellent role is being assumed by discipline about development
of systems and methodology that allow the
combination of several different views (expressed through taxonomies, classifications, contexts, and ontologies) of the
world. In particular, ontology can be considered the boundary topic between the
Semantic Web research and Information
Systems that mostly deserves special attention to the methodological aspects. This
is the argument that urged researchers all
over the world to create outstanding
projects that involve methodological research, and that urged industries to create
ontology-based applications that express
the units’ points of view and, at the same
time, allow knowledge exchange among
different units and their perspectives
(Bonifacio, Bouquet & Cuel, 2002). In
this work, we are interested especially in
ontology, because that it is one of the most
important systems and methods that allows an explicit representation of knowledge and expresses itself a view of the
world. Even if implicitly, each organization, unit, or employee interconnected in
a networked system uses a personal conceptual schema that could be shared or at
least understood among them. Therefore,
developing a good ontology seems to be
one of the critical issues n this area. For
this reason, this chapter focuses on the
methodologies in literature that provide
frameworks for developing
Formal Ontologies
. Frameworks are provided by
ontology creation tools, which explicitly
or implicitly endow a series of steps that
the developer should follow. For instance,
some ontology development tools make
available documentation that describes the
better way in which an ontology developer might create an ontology; other ontology development tools implicitly force
the developer to follow some specific steps
during the process of ontology creation.
