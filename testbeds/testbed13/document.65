Today’s most widely used encryption methods will not be strong enough resist
quantum computers.

It is an inevitability that cryptographers dread: the arrival of powerful
quantum computers that can break the security of the Internet. Although these
devices are thought to be a decade or more away, researchers are adamant that
preparations must begin now.

Computer-security specialists are meeting in Germany this week to discuss
quantum-resistant replacements for today’s cryptographic systems — the
protocols used to scramble and protect private information as it traverses the
web and other digital networks. Although today’s hackers can, and often do,
steal private information by guessing passwords, impersonating authorized
users or installing malicious software on computer networks, existing
computers are unable to crack standard forms of encryption used to send
sensitive data over the Internet.

But on the day that the first large quantum computer comes online, some
widespread and crucial encryption methods will be rendered obsolete. Quantum
computers exploit laws that govern subatomic particles, so they could easily
defeat existing encryption methods.

“I’m genuinely worried we’re not going to be ready in time,” says Michele
Mosca, co-founder of the Institute for Quantum Computing (IQC) at the
University of Waterloo in Canada and chief executive of evolutionQ, a cyber-
security consulting company.

It will take years for governments and industry to settle on quantum-safe
replacements for today’s encryption methods. Any proposed replacement — even
if it seems impregnable at first — must withstand multitudes of real and
theoretical challenges before it is considered reliable enough to protect the
transfer of intellectual property, financial data and state secrets.

“To trust a cryptosystem, you need a lot of people to scrutinize it and try to
devise attacks on it and see if it has any flaws,” says Stephen Jordan, a
physicist at the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in
Gaithersburg, Maryland. “That takes a long time.”

This week’s workshop, held at the Schloss Dagstuhl–Leibniz Center for
Informatics in Wadern, is one of several this year bringing together
cryptographers, physicists and mathematicians to evaluate and develop
cryptographic tools that are less vulnerable to quantum computers. NIST hosted
its own workshop in April, and the IQC will team up with the European
Telecommunications Standards Institute for another, in early October in Seoul.

Intelligence agencies have also taken notice. On 11 August, the US National
Security Agency (NSA) revealed its intention to transition to quantum-
resistant protocols when it released security recommendations to its vendors
and clients. And in a memo posted on its website earlier this year, the Dutch
General Intelligence and Security Service singled out a looming threat that
adds even more urgency to the need for quantum-safe encryption. In a scenario
it calls ‘intercept now, decrypt later’, a nefarious attacker could start
intercepting and storing financial transactions, personal e-mails and other
sensitive encrypted traffic and then unscramble it all once a quantum computer
becomes available. “I wouldn’t be at all surprised if people are doing that,”
says Jordan.

As far back as 1994, mathematician Peter Shor showed that a quantum computer
would be able to quickly foil ‘RSA encryption’, one of the major safeguards
used today (P. W. Shor Preprint available at http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-
ph/9508027v2; 1995). At the time, it was not clear whether such a machine
would ever be built, says Mosca, because researchers assumed that it would
need to operate flawlessly. But a theoretical discovery in 1996 showed that up
to a limit, a quantum computer with some flaws could be just as effective as a
perfect one.

Published experiments with small quantum devices are starting to approach this
faultiness threshold, notes Mosca. And because secretive organizations such as
the NSA are keenly interested in the technology, it is widely assumed that
these published results do not represent the cutting edge of research. “We
have to assume there’s going to be people that are a few years ahead of what’s
available in the public literature,” says Mosca. “You can’t wait for the
headlines in _The__ New York Times _to have your plan in place.”

The safety of today’s Internet traffic relies in part on a type of encryption
called public-key cryptography — which includes RSA — to establish secret
communication between users. A sender uses a freely available digital key to
lock a message, which can be unlocked only with a secret key held by the
recipient. The security of RSA depends on the difficulty of breaking up a
large number into its prime factors, which serve as its secret key. In
general, the larger the number, the harder this problem is to solve.

Researchers believe that it takes existing computers a long time to factorize
big numbers, partly because no one has yet discovered how to do it quickly.
But quantum computers could factorize a large number exponentially faster than
any conventional computer, and this nullifies RSA’s reliance on factoring
being difficult.

Several options already exist for new public-key cryptosystems. These replace
the factoring problem with other difficult mathematics problems that are not
expected to yield to quantum computers. Although these systems are not
perfectly safe, researchers think that they are secure enough to protect
secrets from quantum computers for all practical purposes.

One such system is lattice-based cryptography, in which the public key is a
grid-like collection of points in a high-dimensional mathematical space. One
way to send a secret message is to hide it some distance from a point in the
lattice. Working out how far the encrypted message is to a lattice point is a
difficult problem for any computer, conventional or quantum. But the secret
key provides a simple way to determine how close the encrypted message is to a
lattice point.

A second option, known as McEliece encryption, hides a message by first
representing it as the solution to a simple linear algebra problem. The public
key transforms the simple problem into one that seems much more difficult. But
only someone who knows how to undo this transformation — that is, who has the
private key — can read the secret message.

One drawback of these replacements is that they require up to 1,000 times more
memory to store public keys than existing methods, although some lattice-based
systems have keys not much bigger than those used by RSA. But both methods
encrypt and decrypt data faster than today’s systems, because they rely on
simple multiplication and addition, whereas RSA uses more-complex arithmetic.

PQCRYPTO, a European consortium of quantum-cryptography researchers in
academia and industry, released a preliminary report on 7 September
recommending cryptographic techniques that are resistant to quantum computers
(see go.nature.com/5kellc). It favoured the McEliece system, which has
resisted attacks since 1978, for public-key cryptography. Tanja Lange, head of
the €3.9-million (US$4.3-million) project, favours the safest possible choices
for early adopters. “Sizes and speed will improve during the project,” she
says, “but anybody switching over now will get the best security.”

# Corrections

Corrected:

    

An earlier version of this story incorrectly named the location for the
cryptography workshop that began on 6 September. The workshop was held at the
Schloss Dagstuhl–Leibniz Center for Informatics in Wadern, not the Leibniz
Center for Informatics in Oktavie-Allee.

    How secure is RSA and when you say the more numbers are you talking about the bit? I'm interested in IT security and would love to learn more..Glad I found this site. For now, I sell RAM http://micro-star.com
