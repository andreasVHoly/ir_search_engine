# Google's new quantum computer is '100 million times faster than your PC'

##  Google and Nasa have been working on a lightning-fast quantum computer
that is 3,600 times faster than a supercomputer at solving complex problems

Has Google won the race to build the world's first commercial quantum
computer?

The technology company's artificial intelligence lab believe they may finally
have proof that their opinion-dividing quantum computer actually works.

Google and Nasa announced they were collaborating on the D-Wave X2 quantum
computer, which they say is 100 million times faster than a conventional
computer chip, in 2013. It can answer certain algorithms in seconds rather
than years.

Google director of engineering, Hartmut Neven, said: "For a specific,
carefully crafted proof-of-concept problem we achieve a 100-million-fold
speed-up."

In a blog post he added: "We found that for problem instances involving nearly
1,000 binary variables, quantum annealing significantly outperforms its
classical counterpart, simulated annealing. It is more than 108 times faster
than simulated annealing running on a single core.

It is a truly disruptive technology that could change how we do everything

"We also compared the quantum hardware to another algorithm called Quantum
Monte Carlo. This is a method designed to emulate the behaviour of quantum
systems, but it runs on conventional processors.

"While the scaling with size between these two methods is comparable, they are
again separated by a large factor sometimes as high as 108."

However, Matthias Troyer of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in
Zurich said he wasn't convinced.

"You need to read the fine print," he told New Scientist. "This is 108 times
faster than some specific classical algorithm on problems designed to be very
hard for that algorithm but easy for D-Wave."

Hemet does admit in his blog post that other algorithms can currently beat
D-wave but says Google expect "those methods will soon become ineffective".

According to Engadget, the computer figures out the "most efficient overall
course of action to complete a task when given a set number of options" and
could be key to the development of next-generation artificial intelligence.

Sceptics have questioned if the computer actually taps into quantum physics to
solve algorithms but now Google and Nasa say they have proof.

"It is a truly disruptive technology that could change how we do everything,"
said Deepak Biswas, director of exploration technology at Nasa's Ames research
centre in California.
