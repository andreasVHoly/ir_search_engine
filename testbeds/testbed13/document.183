# IBM Wants Everyone to Try a Quantum Computer

SAN FRANCISCO — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada grabbed international
headlines recently with a simple explanation of a cutting-edge technology
called quantum computing. Now IBM is trying to do something similar by making
a research-oriented quantum computer and a — relatively — simple tutorial
available online for anyone to try.

The possibilities of a new class of computers that are able to exploit the
most basic properties of energy and matter to speed calculations beyond what
is possible with today’s digital systems has long held both promise and
controversy. The systems are based on the notion of a “qubit,” or quantum bit
— a basic value capable of encompassing more information than the 1’s and 0’s
that are the basis of classical digital computing.

A computing system composed of just five qubits, which is what IBM built,
would not be able to replace current personal computers. However, the IBM
Quantum Experience will allow students, hobbyists and even serious researchers
to experiment with algorithms that are radically different from the ones now
used for everything from word processing to speech recognition.

“It’s meant to be educational, but also to be the beginnings of a larger
framework,” said Jerry M. Chow, manager of the Experimental Quantum Computing
Group at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.

IBM researchers have recently demonstrated a quantum computer that they
believe will one day be scaled up to a machine that might have hundreds of
qubits and be able to run a wide range of algorithms more quickly than today’s
computers.

Some quantum computing theorists believe that such a computer one day might be
designed as a “universal” computer capable of performing any task much faster
than machines now in use.

IBM has been gradually enhancing the power of its quantum computer, which is
assembled from a network of qubits made from metals that become
superconducting when they are cooled to temperatures near absolute zero.

Researchers at the company announced the construction of a four-bit quantum
computer last year and in February reported they added a fifth qubit and were
making progress in refining certain error-correcting methods that are
important for quantum computing.

The IBM quantum computer will offer visually oriented online tutorials that
are intended to help people and companies understand how programming such a
computer will be different from programming a digital computer. In addition to
visual simulations of quantum computing, it will include a gamelike system
that will parcel out access to the actual quantum computer for online users.

The idea of computers that might exploit the “spooky” laws of quantum behavior
that describe nature at an atomic level was first broached by the physicist
Richard Feynman in 1981. Since then, scientists have proposed specialized
algorithms that might allow quantum computers to break computer codes or even
simulate complex biological processes.

The IBM simulator is not the first quantum computing simulator available
online. For example, in 2014 Google engineers made available the Quantum
Computing Playground that allows online users to play with a simulated quantum
computer with between six and 22 qubits.
