# Next at Microsoft: 1 year on

This week marks the one year anniversary of the launch of Next at Microsoft.
It's been a busy year for me personally and the blog - we launched quietly and
have slowly built momentum and a loyal following. If you're a regular reader,
thanks for your time - I know you have plenty of other places you could be
spending it. If you're a new reader, have a look around, click some of the
tags on the right as we have a lot of content in just a year.

Our goal in launching Next was to provide an insiders look at some of the cool
things going on inside the company. With 90,000 employees and hundreds of
products that span business and consumer, mobile technology, search,
entertainment, gaming, music, cloud, tools, advertising and much more it can
be hard to get your head around Microsoft at times. Next aims to shine a light
on interesting areas by looking _across _the company at key trends such as
natural user interface (NUI), the Internet of Things, displays everywhere,
cloud and social. Our sister site, News Center covers these in depth from a
news point of view and Next aims to provide sort of a magazine supplement to
that.

As I head towards my 15th year at Microsoft, this definitely goes down as one
of the most fun jobs I've had in that time. I get to meet lots of the people
behind the scenes at Microsoft who are building the future as well as touring
invited guests around the places on our campus where they're doing it. Next
week, we'll take a look at what's coming on Next - in the run up to CES
amongst other things. This week, I thought it'd be fun to look back on some
key topics and key posts over the last year - the first, coming later today,
will look at NUI.

Thanks again for reading - onward to another year of looking at What's Next.
