#  All about... Quantum Computing

## Wondering what the Nobel Prize in Physics 2012 is all about? Let us
help……..

With the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Physics being awarded to two
researchers working in the field of quantum optics, many people are trying to
get their heads around what the two men are being rewarded for. We're sure
it's worthy but what's it really all about?  
  
Explanations will follow but, first, let me set the scene. We're going to look
at their success through the microcosm of quantum computers as this is one of
the applications that pundits have mentioned. So, here we go…..  
  
Normal computers process binary information - this means that something is
either on or off, or in shorthand 1 or 0. British mathematician Alan Turing
proved that you can do any calculation if you have enough switches that you
can turn on or off. Quantum computers are being claimed as the next big thing
because they take us beyond the binary and give us the capability to undertake
a new kind of calculation.  Quantum computers' prowess stems from their
switches, which can be both on and off at the same time. They can be put in a
so-called 'superposition' of states.  
  
Imagine trying to do a calculation where you wanted to try lots of different
numbers to see which one was correct. In a normal computer, you'd have to try
each one in turn. Advances in processor speeds have made these calculations
very fast, but the trick a quantum computer can do is to try multiple numbers
at the same time using the superposition of states. These make quantum
computers radically faster at doing certain calculations. But there are
several hurdles to creating a working quantum computer, but the work from the
two Nobel Prize winners has moved us two steps closer to achieving this.  
  
The two Nobel Prize winners have been rewarded for their measurement of
activity on an atomic scale. It's at this atomic scale, where the quantum
world comes to life, that advances must be made in order to create quantum
computers.  
  
Wineland's work involves trapping ions - electrically charged atoms - using
lasers. They are trapped in order to study them. As the ions are being held
very still, they don't have much energy. When a laser pulse is aimed at one
ion, the ion captures a small bit of energy. Controlling the amount of energy
is crucial as the right amount of energy will put the ion into the
superposition state. If there are other ions nearby they will also be affected
and the superposition will be shared, or what scientist call coupled. The
ability to manually place ions in this state has triggered high hopes for
quantum computers and already offers us new atomic clocks of extraordinary
precision, much needed for a huge range of communications and synchronisation
technologies.  
  
Another advance comes from Haroche. He has created a special cavity where
microwaves bounce between two supercooled (mega, mega frozen) mirrors. The
microwave is very short-lived (tenth of a second).  Haroche's trick is to
sense whether there is a microwave in the cavity or whether it has decayed.
This is done by sending atoms of rubidium through the cavity with the
microwaves. The rubidium changes ever so slightly because of the presence of
microwaves. When the rubidium does change, it becomes entangled with the
microwave. Entanglement means that the information about the microwave can be
found out from the rubidium without disturbing the microwave. Entanglement is
another technique that excites those dreaming of super powerful quantum
computers.  
  
These two have advanced our understanding of some very basic concepts of
quantum physics and have helped kick off what we can hope will be a revolution
in computing as the quantum world becomes clearer and clearer. You won't be
trading in your PC tomorrow for a quantum computer but Wineland and Haroche
have brought us a big step closer to a new age in computing.
