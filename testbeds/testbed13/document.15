For years, our personal computers were made up of monitors, keyboards, and a
big beige box. Then laptops came along and changed everything—until a small,
flat plate of glass encased in metal, dubbed the iPhone, showed up and changed
everything _again_, followed shortly thereafter by an even larger plate of
glass called the iPad that changed things even more.

As exciting as the iPad was, the original came to us five years ago. Today, we
once again face major shifts in for computing. What will that future look
like, both in the near term and the slightly further-off future?

Peering into that which hasn’t happened yet is a perilous business, but here
are some new visions for computing that technology companies are rolling out
soon—as well as a few radical, yet compelling dreams that are still years away
from becoming tangible.

# The near term

## Virtual reality

We’ve already got basic virtual reality headsets in the form of Google
Cardboard and Samsung Gear VR. But these two models are limited because they
rely on a smartphone to double as the VR display, and the software they run
are mere mobile apps that offer a fraction of what’s possible with a full PC’s
power.

Soon, the _real_ heavyweights of VR will make their long-expected debuts,
bringing with them dedicated displays, positional tracking, and  newly
designed made-for-VR controllers.

The long-awaited  Oculus Rift will finally show up  by the end of March 2016,
the  SteamVR-powered HTC Vive  is launching in very limited numbers by the
time the holidays roll around, and at some point after both of those, Sony
should release  PlayStation VR, also known as Project Morpheus.

Virtual reality promises to change the way we play games, do business, train
soldiers, and  perceive the very world around us. For all that promise to live
up to the hype, however, these kits need to be affordable. Right now all we
can say is that  Oculus might be priced affordably, the Vive’s room-scale
experience probably won’t be, and we have no idea about the PlayStation VR.

## Augmented reality

A close cousin of virtual reality, augmented reality is something we’ve been
playing with on smartphones for years. The easiest way to think of the
difference is that virtual reality immerses you in a 100-percent digital
experience, while augmented reality creates a digital overlay on top of the
physical world.

> **Further reading: ** Why virtual reality is better than augmented reality
for gaming

Microsoft’s HoloLens captures the most attention in the augmented reality
realm these days. The device may soon allow you to fight off _Minecraft_
Zombies and Creepers coming at you from behind your couch. It will allow
medical students to view a 3D model of the heart right in the middle of the
classroom, help non-electricians successfully wire a broken lightswitch, and
much more.

Microsoft isn’t the only company working on augmented reality. Another notable
player is Magic Leap, a secretive start-up that is full of promises and short
on specifics, while a team of former Valve engineers are  working on CastAR.

Unfortunately, there’s no word on when we might see these augmented reality
headsets in the real world.

## Intel’s wireless future

PCs are great for gaming, getting working done, gaming, surfing the Internet,
and gaming, but _man_ they need a lot of wires. Intel hopes to reduce our
dependency on little black tubes snaking around and under our desks with new
wireless technologies—a wire-free future for the PC.

Intel’s been pushing WiGig, a standard for wireless gigabit data links
currently supported by Dell and HP. WiGig can connect monitors, hard drives,
and other peripherals to your PC _sans_ cables.

Intel is also working on a method for wirelessly charging your laptop with a
pad delivering up to 20 watts of power. We hope to see laptops charging
wirelessly in 2016.

## Perceptual computing

A pet project of Intel’s for a few years now, Perceptual computing is the idea
of interacting with your PC using natural senses rather than traditional
interface methods. Instead of a keyboard, you might use hand gestures. Instead
of clicking a pause button on a video, it might stop based on eye-tracking.

To move conceptual computing from trade show demos to real-life applications,
however, PC users need the right equipment. That’s just starting to happen now
with Windows 10 laptops and  PCs loaded with RealSense cameras, which (among
other things) team with Windows Hello biometric security to unlock your PC
with your face—no password required.

## Smartphone as PC

Blame it on Motorola’s (failed) Atrix, but the idea of your smartphone's
doubling as a PC when docked just won’t go away. But so far, all we’ve seen
are smartphones that can slip into a customized desktop version of Android or
a Chrome OS-like browser-based system when docked.

Nevertheless, the reality of a full desktop powered by a smartphone is now
closer than ever, thanks to Microsoft’s work on a Windows 10 Mobile feature
called Continuum. Continuum allows Windows 10 phones to display a Windows
desktop-like experience when connected to an external monitor. You can also
connect an external keyboard and mouse, or use the phone’s display itself to
control the “PC.”

Canonical

Canonical has a similar concept, where an Ubuntu smartphone can display a full
Linux desktop when docked. The concept was first introduced for the
crowdfunded Ubuntu Edge smartphone, which raised more than $12 million. Though
it fell short of its $32 million goal, the dream didn’t die: Ubuntu phones
that double as Linux PCs  should roll out sooner than later.

Continuum, meanwhile, will show up on Windows 10 mobile devices later in 2015.

## Wall computing

Microsoft’s dream of a wall-sized computer is alive and well. It’s not a new
dream, however—the massive Perceptive Pixel display was something of a novelty
that not many people besides Bill Gates ever used.

Nevertheless, Microsoft is trying again with the upcoming Surface Hub. This
84-inch, 4K business-focused touchscreen looks like an amazing device to play
around with. It runs Windows 10 and can be used for pretty much anything you
use a PC for today, including video conferencing and presentations.
Microsoft’s aim here is not just to make a big PC, but to digitize the
whiteboard and take advantage of all the possibilities such a concept entails.

The Surface Hub will roll out in January 2016, four months after its  original
launch date of September 1, 2015.
