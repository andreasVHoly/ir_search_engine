Quantum computing may be closer than ever. In a critical breakthrough for
quantum computing, scientists trialed a quantum processor that's capable of
routing quantum information from different locations.

In this latest study, researchers demonstrated for the first time the perfect
state transfer of an entangled quantum bit, also known as a qubit, on an
integrated photonic device. This perfect state transfer is actually a
promising technique for data routing in large-scale quantum computers.

"The last 10 years has seen a wealth of theoretical proposals, but until now
it has never been experimentally realized," said Alberto Peruzzo, one of the
researchers involved in the new study. "Our device uses highly optimized
quantum tunneling to relocate qubits between distant sites. It's a
breakthrough that has the potential to open up quantum computing in the near
future."

Quantum computers have the potential to be much faster at solving problems
than regular computers. This is largely due to the fact that qubits can be in
both states at once, rather than just being 1s or just being 0s. This state
shortens the time for computing.

"Quantum computers promise to solve vital tasks that are currently
unmanageable on today's standard computers and the need to delve deeper in
this area has motivated a worldwide scientific and engineering effort to
develop quantum technologies," Peruzzo said. "It could make the critical
difference for discovering new drugs, developing a perfectly secure quantum
Internet and even improving facial recognition."

A key requirement for any information technology is the ability to relocate
data between locations. In the case of full scale quantum computers, these
machines will contain millions of qubits that are all interconnected that will
allow researchers to obtain much greater computational power.

In this case, researchers experimentally relocated qubits, encoded in single
particles of light, between distant locations. During the protocol, the
quantum state is maintained and entanglement is preserved. These are key for
quantum computing.

The new findings could be huge for quantum computing in the future. More
specifically, it shows an experimental version of quantum tunneling to
relocate qubits.

The findings were published in the April edition of the journal Nature
Communications.
