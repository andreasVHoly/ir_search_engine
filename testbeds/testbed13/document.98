# Quantum Computing at USRA

###### NASA, Google and USRA establish **Quantum Computing Research
Collaboration** 20% of Computing Time will be Provided to the University and
Industry Research Communities

##

The Universities Space Research Association (USRA) has entered into a joint
Space Act Agreement with NASA and Google, to conduct collaborative research on
the benefits of quantum computing for a range of challenging applications.
This collaboration brings together university research, government research
and industrial research in one of the most cutting edge areas of computing
research today - quantum computing.

## D-Wave 2X™ at NASA's Ames Research Center

For the collaboration, USRA has installed a D-Wave 2X™ quantum computer in the
NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) Facility at NASA's Ames Research Center,
and will operate the computer for the duration of the agreement. The computer
has been upgraded to have a processor with 1152 quantum bits (qubits), and is
planned to be upgraded over time as new processors become available (e.g., a
processor with 2,048 qubits is planned to be the next upgrade). This computer
uses a novel technique referred to as adiabatic quantum computing, which
enables users to solve complex discrete combinatorial optimization problems
using quantum physics.

## USRA Research Opportunities

USRA will manage the science operations for the collaboration, which includes
an allocation of 20% of the computing time to the research community through a
competitive selection process. Computing time will be provided at no-cost.
Through this competitive process, research organizations will be able to
utilize a state-of-the-art quantum computer, and also collaborate with
researchers at NASA, Google and other universities.

Research will focus on the benefits of quantum computing for solving complex
discrete combinatorial optimization problems, including machine learning and
other artificial intelligence problems. Example aeronautics and space
applications include planning and scheduling, software verification and
validation, and power optimization, among others.

This collaboration builds on a thirty-year history of cooperation between the
USRA Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science (RIACS) and NASA's Ames
Research Center, which started with a focus on supercomputing and artificial
intelligence, and now extends that focus to include the intersection of
quantum computing and artificial intelligence.

USRA has an open Quantum Artificial Intelligence Laboratory Research
Opportunity, which will allocate free computer time for research projects to
be run on the D-Wave System at NASA's Ames Research Center (ARC). See
