# Europe’s Billion Euro Bet on Quantum Computing

Quantum computers have been hailed for their revolutionary potential in
everything from space exploration to cancer treatment, so it might not come as
a surprise that Europe is betting big on the ultra-powerful machines.

A new €1 billion ($1.13 billion) project has been announced by the European
Commission aimed at developing quantum technologies over the next 10 years and
placing Europe at the forefront of “the second quantum revolution.”

The Quantum Flagship announced will be similar in size, time scale and
ambition as the EC’s other ongoing Flagship projects: the Graphene Flagship
and the Human Brain Project. As well as quantum computers, the initiative will
aim to address other aspects of quantum technologies, including quantum secure
communication, quantum sensing and quantum simulation.

A spokesperson for the European Commission tells _ Newsweek_: “The €1 billion
flagship initiative on quantum technology will launch in 2018 and place Europe
at the forefront of the second quantum revolution, bringing transformative
advances to science, industry and society.”

Since they were first theorized by the physicist Richard Feynman in 1982,
quantum computers have promised to bring about a new era of ultra-powerful
computing. One of the field’s pioneers, physicist David Deutsch, famously
claimed that quantum computers hold the potential to solve problems that would
take a classical computer longer than the age of the universe.

The Quantum Flagship comes in response to the  Quantum Manifesto, which called
for significant investment into quantum technologies and was endorsed by more
than 3,000 individuals from academia, industry and governmental institutions.

The manifesto, which will be officially released next month at the Quantum
Europe Conference in Amsterdam, states that quantum technologies will create a
new “knowledge-based industrial ecosystem” that will create long-term
economic, scientific and societal benefits.

One of the manifesto’s authors, director of  Integrated Quantum Science and
Technology (IQST) Tommaso Calarco, tells _ Newsweek_ that the Quantum Flagship
is a “now or never moment” for Europe.

“No single company or organisation could achieve significant advances by
themselves,” Calarco says. “Quantum technologies will have an impact on a
number of areas, from security and communications, to health and metrology.

“One of the most ambitious aspects of this is the development of quantum
computers. In the long term we will also see the emergence of quantum
computers. No one expects them to be on the market within the next 10 years.”

Some companies, most notably Canada’s D-Wave, claim to have built quantum
computers, however Calarco and other leading computer scientists and
researchers contend that the machines should not be referred to as quantum
computing systems. NASA, Google and the CIA are among the companies and
organizations working with D-Wave machines.

“D-Wave’s machines are not recognized by the scientific community,” says
Calarco. “That doesn’t mean what they’ve created isn’t extremely exciting. In
eight years they’ve put together a platform that can compete with silicon—a
technology that has been in development for 70 years.”

The EC will be helped by Horizon 2020, the EU Research and Innovation
programme, in funding the Quantum Flagship, as well as other not-yet-named
sources at EU and national levels.

One of the main hopes of the initiative is that quantum technologies will make
the leap from research labs to commercial and industrial applications.
Matthias Troyer, a computational physics professor at the Institute for
Theoretical Physics at ETH Zurich—one of the institutes set to benefit from
the fund—believes the initiative acknowledges the fact that this step is now
ready to be made.

“Quantum technologies have matured to the point where we are ready to
transition from academic projects to the development of competitive commercial
products that within the next decade will be able to perform tasks that
classical devices are incapable of,” Troyer tells _ Newsweek_.

This is a sentiment shared by Ilyas Khan, co-founder and CEO at Cambridge
Quantum Computing (CQC). Khan claims that the Quantum Flagship puts Europe at
the front of the race to build the world’s first quantum machines.

CQC has been one of the pioneers in early quantum computer research and in
2015 developed  the first operating system capable of accurately simulating a
quantum processor. The t|ket> operating system allows research teams to
determine the type of operations a quantum computer can perform.

“It has become increasingly clear that it is now only a matter of a relatively
short time before quantum technologies become of practical importance at the
strategic level for governments and large corporations,” Khan says. “The
elevation of this sector by the European Community is extremely positive.”
