Did you ever wish you could be two things simultaneously? Well, in the
fascinating, far-out world of quantum mechanics that's possible. For years,
scientists have been trying to harness that property to build more powerful
machines that could be 100 million times faster than what we currently use.
That would change many aspects of our lives, from how we keep our data safe
from snoops to how well virtual assistants could get to know us and serve our
needs.

Many experts are skeptical that the companies working on this trippy area of
science have made promising gains. But this week, we got some very exciting
news: Google and NASA offered up evidence that their quantum machine might
actually work.

**So you may be wondering, what the heck is a quantum computer?**

Quantum computers store information in so-called qubits, or quantum bits.
Unlike the bits that regular computers crunch, whose state can switch from 1
to 0, qubits exists as 1 _and _a 0. Trippy, right? That's the part of the
magic sauce that makes a quantum computer revolutionary. But there's more:
another far-out quantum property called entanglement.

Entanglement allows particles to have identical physical properties across
space and maybe time. Einstein called it "spooky action at a distance." (If
you're a fan of _Star Trek_, you're surely familiar with teleportation.
Teleportation is only possible because of entanglement.) A quantum computer
won't teleport you, but it would make computers much more efficient.

As expert Ivan Deutsch told _Quanta Magazine_:

> Each qubit can be entangled with the other qubits in the machine. The
intertwining of quantum “states” exponentially increases the number of 0s and
1s that can be simultaneously processed by an array of qubits. Machines that
can harness the power of quantum logic can deal with exponentially greater
levels of complexity than the most powerful classical computer. Problems that
would take a state-of-the-art classical computer the age of our universe to
solve, can, in theory, be solved by a universal quantum computer in hours.

Awesome right? That would make the fast computer on your lap or the ones in
giant data centers where Google stores your photos and documents look like
snails. That's why government agencies and big tech companies like Google,
Microsoft and IBM are interested in the things.

Unfortunately, as Deustch says, this is also what makes quantum computers so
tricky to use. That state of entanglement is really easy to disrupt. Once that
happens, it goes caput. No bueno.

He puts it more eloquently: "From the beginning, it has not been clear whether
the exponential speed up provided by a quantum computer would be cancelled out
by the exponential complexity needed to protect the system from crashing."

**So what's all the recent fuss about? **

At an event at the NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California,
Google execs discussed new research that lends some proof the quantum computer
Google and NASA share might be actually harnessing quantum physics to compute.

The heart of the quantum computer.

During the event, which was also tied to a paper the search giant posted
online Monday, Google showed that its quantum machine, made by a Canada-based
company called D-Wave Systems, could outperform standard computers on some
tasks, with a speedup of 100 million in some cases! (The computer has more
than 1,000 qubits, according to the company.)

For instance, the speedy quantum computer solved one tricky problem in one
second. It would have taken the run-of-the-mill computer 10,000 years.

In the tech world, it's all about speed. The faster computers can analyze
data, the faster (and better) companies can serve us. For AI, this kind of
speed-up could mean that the models companies like Google, Microsoft and IBM
train to do machine translation, voice recognition, and image classification
could be trained much, much faster. That would be a huge financial boon.

**So how close are we to a quantum-computerized future? **

While there's definitely enthusiasm around these findings, they're by no means
conclusive. The big caveat here is that the conventional computer was using
code similar to the one running on the D-Wave. Researchers were aware of a
different program that could have exploited a flaw in the D-Wave, and
potentially helped it to win.

Among scientists there's been some controversy about whether the computer that
Google and NASA are sharing is, in fact, a full-on quantum machine. (NASA and
Google aren't the only organizations that have bought D-Waves. Lockheed Martin
and USC also have these refrigerator-looking contraptions.)

The end-game is to develop what's called a universal quantum computer, one
that can implement any algorithm fed to it. As of 2013, it was unclear whether
the D-Wave computer was that. As University of Maryland Frank Gaitan, who
worked on that test, told WIRED, the D-Wave machine “uses some kind of quantum
effect that solves some kind of problems” and is really good at solving
optimization problems. But it was still unclear whether it was a universal
quantum computer.

For the likes of Google, that might not matter, since the kinds of things they
might want to do with it _are_ optimization problems. At its core, that's what
AI is.

Google isn't yet using using the technology to power any of its applications,
but if they get them to work the way they're hoping, it probably will. It's
hired top players in the quantum computing world in recent years. The search
giant has a quantum computing group focused on AI in 2013.

“It is a truly disruptive technology that could change how we do everything,”
said Rupak Biswas, director of exploration technology at NASA’s Ames Research
Center.

Or not, if they can't get it to work. Stay tuned.
