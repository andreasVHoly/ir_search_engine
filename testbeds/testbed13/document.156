# IBM Watson CTO: Quantum computing could advance artificial intelligence by
orders of magnitude

The CTO of IBM's supercomputer Watson has spoken of the 'very natural synergy'
between cognitive computing and quantum computingNBC

Combining the vast processing power of quantum computers with cognitive
computing systems like IBM's Watson will lead to huge advances in artificial
intelligence, according to a C-level executive at the US software giant.

Speaking to **IBTimes UK** at the recent Hello Tomorrow conference in Paris,
IBM Watson's chief technology officer Rob High said there was a "very natural
synergy" between cognitive computing and quantum computing, revealing he hoped
to one day see Watson run on a quantum system.

> ### What is quantum computing?

>

> Quantum computers replace traditional bits that are used in digital
communications with quantum bits, or qubits. Potential applications can be
found in a variety of fields, from medicine to space travel.

>

> Qubits exist in a state of superposition, meaning they can be in both states
at once, rather than restricted to either binary state as traditional bits
function.

"I'd love to see a quantum Watson," he said. "IBM Research is actually working
on next generation computing. I can't say exact numbers but a [quantum Watson]
would be orders of magnitude more powerful than systems that are currently
being used.

"Besides the obvious that both cognitive computing and quantum computing
depart substantially from the classical forms of information computing, the
biggest synergies lie in the realisation that increasingly sophisticated
reasoning strategies employed by cognitive computing are going to require
increasingly powerful and efficient underlying computing architectures."

IBM's Watson supercomputer first rose to prominence in 2011 when it became the
first computer to beat human contestants at the US gameshow Jeopardy!

In the years since, IBM and other companies have put Watson's immense
computing power to a variety of uses, from working with doctors to develop
treatment plans for cancer patients, to assisting the world's media in
crunching tennis statistics at Wimbledon.

### Quantum Watson?

IBM is yet to announce plans to integrate a quantum computer system with
Watson but the software giant recently unveiled a new superconducting chip
that demonstrates a technique crucial to the development of quantum computers.

The chip was a leap forward in research into quantum computers, as it was the
first to integrate quantum bits – or qubits – into a two-dimensional grid.
This is important for making a practical machine but there is still a long way
to go before quantum computers find practical use.

Nasa, Google and the CIA are among the companies and organisations also
working on quantum computers, while the UK government has outlined a £270m
($420m) strategy into quantum technology growth through the UK National
Quantum Technology Programme.

Nasa's Quantum Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (QuAIL) is working
specifically on assessing the potential quantum computers have with regards to
artificial intelligence, though the agency is hazy on what exactly any machine
might be used for beyond helping "address Nasa challenges".

IBM's Watson supercomputer is currently being used at Wimbledon to assist
journalists in processing the huge amounts of data generated by tennis
playersIBM

Quantum computers have already been used to test artificial intelligence by
researchers in China, albeit in a very limited capacity. Earlier in 2015, a
team from the country's University of Science and Technology developed a
quantum system capable of recognising handwritten characters in a
demonstration they dubbed quantum artificial intelligence.

"Due to the widespreading importance of artificial intelligence and its
tremendous consuming of computational resources, quantum speed up would be
extremely attractive against the challenges from the Big Data," the abstract
for the team's research paper stated.

This demonstration was on a quantum computer using only four qubits, leading
to speculation of what a system using hundreds – or even thousands – of qubits
would be capable of. Such machines do not yet exist, at least not
commercially, but Canada-based quantum computing firm D-Wave systems recently
claimed it has built a 1,000 qubit quantum computer.

According to Seth Lloyd, a professor of mechanical engineering at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), a machine of just 300 qubits
could be used to "map the whole universe", processing all the information that
has existed since the Big Bang.

For High, introducing quantum computers to the field of cognitive computing
machines such as IBM's Watson represents a logical step in realising the full
benefits of both.

"Cognitive computing does emulate some aspects of human observation,
interpretation and evaluation," he said. "While cognitive systems do not fully
simulate how the human mind actually works, if they're to be useful in
amplifying human cognition, cognitive systems will have to perform with
increasing speed, agility and with lower energy levels. Quantum computing, as
it matures, may benefit cognitive computing in all these aspects."
