#### Astronomers discover three exoplanets similar to Earth and Venus

Quantum computing is still very much in the early research stage, but IBM is
hoping to accelerate the progress around it by making a quantum computer
available to researchers as a cloud service. It is a bold and ambitious idea,
although still very much a small step in trying to understand quantum
computing processing.

IBM is allowing interested parties to access a 5 qubit quantum computer it’s
calling IBM Quantum Experience. The actual hardware is sitting in the IBM
Research Lab in New York State. IBM is providing a programming interface and
the ability to run experimental programs on an actual quantum computer.

Among the challenges here are that quantum computers take enormous cooling
systems that in some cases are colder than outer space (we’re talking
seriously cold). What’s more, they maintain so much information, none of which
is necessarily static, keeping all of that information available long enough
for meaningful analysis is an enormous task. These challenges are akin to
balancing an egg on the tip of a pencil, then figuring out why it fell, Jerry
Chow, Manager of the Experimental Quantum Computing Group at IBM Research
explained.

The programming language IBM created for this project operates almost like
writing music. The programmer can simply drag quantum objects to the “staff”
to write a program.

Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT, Inc. says quantum computers are
different from conventional computers in a couple of essential ways.

“For one, while conventional systems are designed on binary principles (where
opening/closing semiconductor gates represents on/off, or 0/1) quantum systems
utilize “qubits’ which can be on, off or both on and off. In theory, that will
allow resulting systems to perform functions on data utilizing phenomena from
quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement,” King explained to
TechCrunch in an email.

IBM has created its own quantum chip running at 5 qubits.  Chow estimates that
it could take a machine running between 50 and 100 qubits to surpass the
capabilities of today’s fastest super computers. We have a ways to go here,
but this is a good starting point.

But getting there is harder than simply following Moore’s Law with digital
computers on silicon chips. While IBM is still using silicon, there are a
couple of huge hurdles involved in getting more consistent usage. First of all
there is building the computer and second figuring out how to program it, Earl
Joseph, who covers high performance computing for IDC explained in an email.

“This experiment provides the opportunity for a large group of people to start
to learn how to program quantum computers, which will help to develop ways to
use this new type of technology,” Joseph wrote.

He points out there are other such experiments in progress. “NASA Ames and
Google are doing some very interesting work. The large home run will be from a
more general purpose and large size quantum computer. I think it will be an
evolutionary process, with more applications coming on line every few years.”

The hope is that by offering this tool, it will help propel interest and
understanding of quantum computing and create a community of interested
individuals, institutions and researchers who can work together to advance
knowledge about these computers in the coming years.
