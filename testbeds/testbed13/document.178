NASA is giving Navy researchers in San Diego access to an unusually powerful
computer that might help users do such things as better forecast the outcome
of battles and more efficiently control the collective movement of unmanned
vehicles.

Scientists at the Navy's Spawar Systems Center Pacific (SSCP) are already
learning how to use the D-Wave 2X quantum computer housed at the NASA Ames
Research Center near San Francisco.

"The D-Wave is an evolving technology that is faster than a conventional
computer and can do many things at one time," said Joanna Ptasinski, a SSCP
engineer who is involved in the project.

NASA and its partner, Google, say that the D-Wave 2X can run algorithms 100
million times faster than conventional transistor-based computers. Such tests
suggest the quantum computers might be able to handle some problems and tasks
in seconds or minutes, rather than in years and decades. Time magazine
referred to quantum computers as "infinity machines" that could revolutionize
computing.

But scientists caution that they're only at the proof-of-concept stage with
quantum computers, which process information differently than conventional
computers.

SSCP uses scouts to find and evaluate emerging technologies. The goal is to
improve intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, as well as the
communications and computer systems that the Navy uses in everything from
warships to aircraft to vehicles
