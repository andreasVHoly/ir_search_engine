In spring 2013, engineers installed a D-Wave Two™ quantum computer in the NASA
Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) facility at NASA's Ames Research Center. The
system--about the size of a garden storage shed--is housed inside a cryogenics
system within a 10-square-meter shielded room. The system, with approximately
512 superconducting flux qubits is the most powerful of its kind in the world.

Since the quantum computer became operational in fall 2013, researchers at
NASA Ames and other NASA centers have been using it to investigate quantum
approaches to optimization problems in such areas as air traffic control,
autonomy, robotics, navigation and communication, system diagnostics, pattern
recognition, anomaly detection, and mission planning and scheduling. Through
testing of problems in these disciplines, NASA's QuAIL team hopes to
demonstrate that large-scale quantum computers will be able to solve certain
problems much faster than any classical computer using the best currently
known optimization algorithms. Early potential applications of interest to
NASA include validating the transit signals of planets for the Kepler mission,
and planning and scheduling for space missions, including planetary rover
exploration.

## QuAIL Collaboration

Through a five-year, non-reimbursable Space Act Agreement between NASA,
Google, and the Universities Space Research Association (USRA), the QuAIL
project team will conduct four main technology tasks: quantum computer
acceptance tests; development of quantum AI algorithms and mapping onto the
system; development of problem decomposition and hardware embedding
techniques; and creation of quantum-classical hybrid algorithms.

In addition, the broader academic community, through USRA, will be able to
utilize the D-Wave Two system and conduct collaborative research on the
benefits of quantum computing together with researchers at both NASA and
Google.

## D-Wave Two™ Computer

  * Manufacturer: D-Wave Systems Inc.
  * Uses a 1,097-qubit Washington processor 
  * Niobium superconducting loop encodes 2 states as tiny magnetic fields
  * Processor cooled with liquid helium to 20 millikelvin (near absolute zero)
  * Uses 12 kilowatts of power (compared to an average of 4100 kilowatts for the 10 top U.S. supercomputers)

### About Us

The Quantum Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (QuAIL), led by Andre Petukhov,
is comprised of members of the Intelligent Systems Division and the Advanced
Supercomputing Division (NAS). The D-wave quantum computer is housed and
maintained by NAS personnel. The QuAIL team works in close collaboration with
researchers from USRA and Google.
