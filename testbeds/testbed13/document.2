# How Quantum Computers Work

The massive amount of processing power generated by computer manufacturers has
not yet been able to quench our thirst for speed and computing capacity. In
1947, American computer engineer **Howard Aiken** said that just six
electronic digital computers would satisfy the computing needs of the United
States. Others have made similar errant predictions about the amount of
computing power that would support our growing technological needs. Of course,
Aiken didn't count on the large amounts of data generated by scientific
research, the proliferation of personal computers or the emergence of the
Internet, which have only fueled our need for more, more and more computing
power.

Will we ever have the amount of computing power we need or want? If, as
**Moore's Law** states, the number of transistors on a microprocessor
continues to double every 18 months, the year 2020 or 2030 will find the
circuits on a microprocessor measured on an atomic scale. And the logical next
step will be to create **quantum computers**, which will harness the power of
atoms and molecules to perform memory and processing tasks. Quantum computers
have the potential to perform certain calculations significantly faster than
any silicon-based computer.

Scientists have already built basic quantum computers that can perform certain
calculations; but a practical quantum computer is still years away. In this
article, you'll learn what a quantum computer is and just what it'll be used
for in the next era of computing.

You don't have to go back too far to find the origins of quantum computing.
While computers have been around for the majority of the 20th century, quantum
computing was first theorized less than 30 years ago, by a physicist at the
Argonne National Laboratory. **Paul Benioff** is credited with first applying
quantum theory to computers in 1981. Benioff theorized about creating a
quantum Turing machine. Most digital computers, like the one you are using to
read this article, are based on the **Turing Theory**. Learn what this is in
the next section.
