When the sender and receiver share a bell pair, two classical bits can be
packed into one qubit.

In quantum information theory, **superdense coding** is a technique used to
send two bits of classical information using only one qubit.[1][2] It is the
inverse of quantum teleportation, which sends one qubit with two classical
bits.[3] Both superdense coding and quantum teleportation require, and use up,
entanglement between the sender and receiver in the form of Bell pairs.

## Overview[edit]

Suppose Alice would like to send classical information to Bob using qubits,
instead of classical bits. Alice would encode the classical information in a
qubit and send it to Bob. After receiving the qubit, Bob recovers the
classical information via measurement. The question is: how much classical
information can be transmitted per qubit? Since non-orthogonal quantum states
cannot be distinguished reliably[_citation needed_], one would guess that
Alice can do no better than one classical bit per qubit. Holevo's theorem
discusses this bound on efficiency. Thus, there is no advantage gained in
using qubits instead of classical bits[_citation needed_]. However, with the
additional assumption that Alice and Bob share an entangled state, two
classical bits per qubit can be achieved. The term _superdense_ refers to this
doubling of efficiency. Also, it can be proved that the maximum amount of
classical information that can be sent (even while using entangled state)
using one qubit is 2 bits[_citation needed_].

## Details[edit]

Crucial to this procedure is the shared entangled state between Alice and Bob,
and the property of entangled states that a (maximally) entangled state can be
transformed into another state via local manipulation.

Suppose parts of a Bell state, say

    

are distributed to Alice and Bob. The first subsystem, denoted by subscript
_A_, belongs to Alice and the second, _B_, system to Bob. By only manipulating
her particle locally, Alice can transform the composite system into any one of
the Bell states (entanglement cannot be broken using local operations):

  * Suppose Alice wants to send the classical bits 00.

Then she will perform identity unitary operation on her particle. Her
entangled qubit remains unchanged. The resultant tangled qubit would be

  * Suppose Alice wants to send the bits "01". Then she will perform  unitary operation.

is like a quantum NOT gate. After the application of  unitary gate the
resultant entangled quantum state would be

  * Suppose Alice wants to send the bits "10". Then she will perform  unitary operation.

After the application of  unitary gate, the resultant entangled quantum state
would be

  * Suppose Alice wants to send the bits "11". Then she will perform  unitary operation.

After the application of  unitary gate the resultant entangled quantum state
would be

are Pauli gates.  are called Bell states.

Now, if Bob wants to find which classical bits Alice wanted to send he will
perform the  unitary operation followed by unitary operation on the entangled
qubit.

  * If the resultant entangled qubit was  then after the application of the above unitary operations the entangled qubit will become 
  * If the resultant entangled qubit was  then after the application of the above unitary operations the entangled qubit will become 
  * If the resultant entangled qubit was  then after the application of the above unitary operations the entangled qubit will become 
  * If the resultant entangled qubit was  then after the application of the above unitary operations the entangled qubit will become 

So, depending on the message she would like to send, Alice performs one of the
four local operations given above and sends her qubit to Bob. By performing a
projective measurement in the Bell basis on the two particle system, Bob
decodes the desired message.

If some mischievous person, such as Eve, intercepts Alice's qubit en route to
Bob, all that is obtained by Eve is part of an entangled state. Therefore, no
useful information whatsoever is gained by Eve unless she can interact with
Bob's qubit.

## General dense coding scheme[edit]

General dense coding schemes can be formulated in the language used to
describe quantum channels. Alice and Bob share a maximally entangled state
_ω_. Let the subsystems initially possessed by Alice and Bob be labeled 1 and
2, respectively. To transmit the message _x_, Alice applies an appropriate
channel

    

on subsystem 1. On the combined system, this is effected by

    

where _I_ denotes the identity map on subsystem 2. Alice then sends her
subsystem to Bob, who performs a measurement on the combined system to recover
the message. Let the _effects_ of Bob's measurement be _Fy_. The probability
that Bob's measuring apparatus registers the message _y_ is

    

Therefore, to achieve the desired transmission, we require that

    

where _δxy_ is the Kronecker delta.
