Quantum computing is being hailed as the future of data processing, with
promises of performing calculations thousands of times faster than modern
supercomputers while consuming magnitudes less electricity. And in the span of
just two years the only commercially available quantum computer, the D-Wave
One, has already doubled its computational power. Kiss your law goodbye, Mr.
Moore.

Quantum computing differs from classical computing at its most fundamental
level. While traditional computers rely on the alternate bit states of 1 and 0
to store data, quantum computers exploit the fuzzy effects of quantum
mechanics, allowing its "qubits" to exist as a 1, 0, or both simultaneously,
a.k.a "superposition." So while a traditional computer will sequentially
explore the potential solutions to a mathematical optimization problem, the
quantum system looks at every potential solution simultaneously, known as
quantum annealing, and returns answers—not just the single "best" but nearly
10,000 close alternatives as well—in roughly a second. What's more, unlike
traditional computers which rely on logic gates to manipulate bits, the D-Wave
system uses an adiabatic, which reads out the ground state of its qubits to
find a solution.

_The 128-qubit array of the DW1_

When the original D-Wave One (DW1) debuted in May, 2011, it utilized a 128
qubit chip-set, magnitudes faster than existing supercomputer technology, and
was immediately purchased by research labs and defense contractors such as
Lockheed, which installed one at USC in LA. However the recently released
D-Wave Two (DW2), blows its predecessor out of the water using a massive 512
qubit array.

Each qubit is a small, superconducting processor that exploits quantum
mechanical effects. These effects are magnified the more qubits that are
connected to one another. Were every one of the 509 functional qubits in the
D-Wave Two hooked up to one another, the system would wield processing powers
100 orders of magnitude more powerful its predecessor. However, since each DW2
qubit only communicates directly seven other qubits in tightly packed blocks
or nodes—these nodes are then connected to other 8-qubit nodes in the
lattice—the DW2 is only about _300,000 times_ more powerful than the D-Wave
One. So, you know, just a modest spec bump.

Heck, even when the DW2 is only using 439 qubits, as it did when D-Wave
Systems consultant, Catherine McGeoch, tested it against state of the art
workstations running top of the line CPLEX optimization algorithms, the DW2
produced results 3,600 times faster—providing 100 solutions in a half second.
The workstations required a half hour to produce the same.

But in order to take full advantage quantum effects, the DW2 requires very
specific, extreme conditions. For one, it operates at 0.02 Kelvin—150 times
colder than the depths of interstellar space and just two degrees above
absolute zero—in a vacuum _10 billion times_ lower than standard atmospheric
pressure and experiences 50,000 times less magnetic interference thanks to its
heavy shielding. Surprisingly, achieving these temperatures consumes just
15.5kW and takes up just ten square meters of floor space, compared to the
thousands of kilowatts and warehouses of space that traditional super
computers require.

Google, NASA, and the Universities Space Research Association all kicked in on
a DW2 in May of last year—D-Wave Systems won't quote prices though the BBC
estimates its cost at about $15 million—for machine learning research (which
would help explain why Google's been snapping up every AI designer and
robotics company it could get its hands on over the last six months). Quantum
computing still has a way to go before it's reliable, but between recent
breakthroughs and kickass hardware, it shouldn't be long before it's ready to
catapult us into the future. [Wiki 1, 2 \- Extremetech \- BBC \- D-Wave
