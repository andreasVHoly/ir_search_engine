# Quantum Computer Science (16w5029)

Arriving in Banff, Alberta Sunday, April 17 and departing Friday April 22,
2016

## Organizers

Michele Mosca (University of Waterloo)

Martin Roetteler (Microsoft Research)

Peter Selinger (Dalhousie University)

## Objectives

The workshop aims to bring together researchers from quantum computing---in
particular those focusing on quantum algorithms and quantum error correction,
and classical programming languages. Open questions that we anticipate this
group to tackle include new methods for circuit synthesis and optimization,
compiler optimizations and rewriting, embedded languages versus non-embedded
languages, implementations of type systems and error reporting for quantum
languages, techniques for verifying the correctness of quantum programs, and
new techniques for compiling efficient circuits and protocols for fault-
tolerant questions and their 2D layout.  
  

More than half of the proposed participants were part of the IARPA QCS
program, which ran from 2011--2013 and gave the field of quantum programming
languages and quantum circuit synthesis a large push. We expect that these
individuals will continue research in this field and therefore would have an
natural interest in attending this workshop. The remaining invitees with bring
many new ideas to this rapidly evolving research area in the intersection of
quantum computing and programming languages.  
  

Currently, only very few opportunities exist to bring together experts from
the fields of quantum computing, programming languages, and compiler design;
to give them the opportunity to engage in exchange of ideas; and to report on
progress for both theoretical and implementation aspects. We also expect a
vibrant open problems session as well as exchange of benchmarks, i.e., for the
best known circuits for some classes of transformations that are important for
the synthesis of large quantum algorithms.
