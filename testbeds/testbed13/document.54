# A Quantum Computer Has Been Hooked Up to the Cloud For the First Time

You can now entangle quantum qubits directly from your smartphone.

A team at IBM has announced today that it has hooked up a quantum
processor—housed at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in New York—to the
cloud. For the first time in history, non-scientists and scientists alike can
run quantum experiments from their desktop or mobile devices.

"It's really about starting to have a new community of quantum learners," said
Jay Gambetta, manager of the Theory of Quantum Computing and Information Group
at IBM. "We're trying to take the mysteriousness out of quantum."

The five-qubit processor is maintained at a temperature of 15 millikelvin.
That’s 180 times colder than outer space.

IBM is calling the cloud-based quantum platform the IBM Research Quantum
Experience (which consists of a simulator as well as the live processor), and
it's a step in the direction of creating a universal quantum computer: one
that can perform any calculation that is in the realm of what quantum
mechanics predicts. No such computer exists today, but IBM suspects that
researchers will find the means to develop one within the next decade.

Quantum computing is a complicated beast compared to classical computing.
Classical computers use bits to process information, where a bit represents
either a zero or a one. Quantum computing, on other other hand, employs
qubits—which represent either a zero, a one, or a superposition of both.

IBM's quantum computer holds five superconducting qubits, a relatively small
amount. The most expensive modern-day classical computer could emulate a 30-
or 40-qubit system, the researchers say. So it's not as though IBM's cloud-
based quantum processor is going to solve anything that scientists can't
already figure out using a classical computer. Instead, the strength of IBM's
processor is derived from its use as an educational tool—anyone who is curious
can experiment, play with real qubits, and explore tutorials related to
quantum computing.

In addition, scientists who access the processor will be able to use it to
develop a better intuition for quantum computing. "We'll know more about
nature itself when we understand these algorithms," Gambetta said.
Specifically, experts can become more skilled at parsing quantum "noise," or
the uncertainty in physical characteristics of quantum nature. If they can
minimize uncertainty—flukes in the system that cause the quantum computer to
malfunction—in a small, five-qubit processor, then they can scale those
lessons to create stronger quantum computers in the future.

Eventually, given the invention of 50- to 100-qubit processors, scientists may
be able to deduce the complex behavior of molecules using quantum computing.
They could even make significant strides in artificial intelligence,
processing big data, and more.

IBM's announcement also marks the launch of the IBM Research Frontiers
Institute, a consortium of organizations from various industries (including
Samsung and Honda) that plans to collaborate on ground-breaking computing
technologies. As classical computing becomes less relevant and Moore's law
starts to fade, such projects will become even more necessary. As Gambetta
noted, the amount we know about quantum computing now is similar to what we
knew about classical computing in the 1950s and 60s. It's back to square one.

"Everything you know about computing, you have to relearn it," he said.
