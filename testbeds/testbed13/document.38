# Quantum Computers: The Future of Everyday Life

Category: Everyday Physics

Quantum computers have recently created a lot of buzz in the science world.
Fancy terms like qubits and algorithms are being tossed around, along with the
very real possibility of  artificial intelligence. But how likely is it that
any of these things will actually affect you personally? Better still, when
should you start expecting it to all happen?  

## Quantum Computers: The Backstory

Quantum computers have quite a few distinct differences from regular
computers. They rely on the quantum nature of matter - that is, at subatomic
levels, particles can act like waves - to analyze and perform complex
operations of data. Regularly, digital computers analyze encoded data through
binary digits, also known as "bits". These bits are defined as either a 0 or 1
and do not change. However, quantum computation uses "qubits" whereby these
values can be a superposition of either a 0 or 1. By not definitively giving
these qubits a value, they can hold a lot more information than a regular bit,
allowing a computer to perform more complex routines in a fraction of the
time.  

The field of quantum computing was first pioneered by Paul Benioff and Yuri
Manin in 1980, and further pursued by Richard Feynman in 1982 and David
Deutsch in 1985. Feynman's contributions to quantum computing (among other
areas in quantum mechanics) have been widely celebrated in the physics
community, with a special tribute to him coming up next year. The development
is currently still in its early years, but has gained worldwide interest as
scientists have managed to perform quantum computational operations on a small
number of quantum bits.

## Quantum Computers and Industry

Many industries around the world will soon reap the benefits of quantum
computing. An area in particular that will benefit immensely is meteorology.
At the moment, measuring the weather is an educated guess at best. But with
quantum computers, data from multiple streams (instruments) can be measured
simultaneously, which means that extreme weather warnings can be issued
earlier and help save lives. Not only that, but the effects humans are having
on the weather can help us determine what measures need to be taken to prevent
further damage.  

Another area to benefit from quantum computing is the traffic sector. Both air
and ground-based traffic would benefit from this as their routes can be
optimally calculated with multiple factors involved. So say goodbye to traffic
jams and airport delays!

We also put a lot of effort into cyber security in this day and age. Quantum
computing can help with the encryption process of our personal information
such as credit cards, emails and cloud storage using quantum key distribution.
This process utilizes quantum mechanics in such a way that the sent message
becomes useless if it is intercepted by an outsider.

## Quantum Computers and Research

Along with the more direct applications of quantum computing, many researchers
stand to benefit from this type of computer. The first being the medical
industry. To develop a new drug, researchers must test millions upon millions
of molecular combinations to determine whether any have the right properties
to fight against a disease. This sort of process takes a significant amount of
time and costs millions of dollars, and even then, some of these combinations
still fail at the trial phase. With quantum computers, this process would take
only a fraction of the time, cutting costs and reducing the development time
for the drug. Another application of quantum computing is the sequencing and
analyzation of people's genes, allowing for personalized drugs and healthcare
to be more readily available to a wide variety of people.

Quantum computing clearly has a knack for handling big loads of data, which is
why it is no surprise that it will also benefit space exploration. Currently,
the Kepler Space Telescope has confirmed nearly 2000 planets outside our solar
system. With the aid of a quantum computer, more data can be analyzed within
any given telescope and help identify which of these planets could harbor
life, not to mention capture any planets missed with the initial observations.

And unlike regular computers, quantum computers can learn from experience.
They can self correct, just like a human. If it is aware of a program that
constantly makes mistakes, it can modify that code to make it work properly.
This is known as machine learning. You may have seen it before on your
facebook newsfeed when you like certain posts and then notice ads popping up
of similar relevance. It is this sort of technology that will help advance
technology in areas like driverless cars and artificial intelligence.

## What This all Means for the General Population

Although it may not be practical for you to personally own a quantum computer,
it doesn't mean that you won't benefit from the results quantum computing will
have on the world.

For example, imagine yourself getting ready for a day at work. You look at the
weather forecast for the day so you know what to wear without
freezing/sweating profusely. Thanks to quantum computers, the forecast is much
more reliable, and you know to bring your umbrella for the rain later that
day. You go to hop in your car but remember that you need to drop off your dry
cleaning, drop off the kids, pick up your friend, and avoid the major highway
because of a nasty accident. Thanks to quantum computers, your GPS is now able
to not only predict the fastest and most traffic-free route for you, but to do
it in real time as well. Now, by the time you get to work, you realize that
you accidentally made a purchase on a dodgy website. But thanks to the new
software that came out last week which incorporates quantum computing, your
credit card information is still safe and sound. And on your way home after
work, you go to the pharmacy to pick up the special medicine your mom needs
for her illness. Just a few years ago this cure didn't exist, but with the
advancements in quantum computing, doctors and scientists were able to work
together to find a cure and make it available in record time.

Although you may never own a quantum computer, the presence of quantum
computing will soon impact your life in some way. With big companies like
Google and NASA hopping on board, it shouldn't take long before we start
seeing some of these life-changing applications taking place. Just be patient.
That accurate weather forecast or traffic-predicting GPS may not be so far off
after all!
