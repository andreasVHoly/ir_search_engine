# Why quantum computing will be civilisation's next big revolution

## Eric Ladizinsky

16 October 14  by Katie Collins

Michael Newington Gray

While most of the world has just about got to grips with basic computing,
D-Wave cofounder Eric Ladizinsky is trying to get to grips with quantum
computing.

"I'm very concerned about the future," he tells the audience at WIRED2014 in
London. "We are putting enormous strains on our environments." Quantum
computing is the the next thing that will be able to change this, he believes.
Discovering new ways of harnessing nature has, throughout history, always led
to radical developments in our capabilities as humans. And Ladizinsky thinks
the next biggest revolution will be in quantum computing.

Whenever there is a revolution in our civilisation -- whether that's the
discovery of fire, tool-making, agriculture or electronic -- there is always a
first revolution in the use of a resource. However, at this time "we don't
know how to manipulate it in a detailed way". It means that it is always
followed by a second revolution -- a paradigm shift -- during which we learn
to grapple with the resource when its use has grown beyond our initial
understanding.

This is where we are with computing now, he believes. Classical computing is
capable of crunching enormous amounts of data, but, explains Ladizinsky,
"right now we're not necessarily able to extract meaningful insights from that
data on timescales that matter". This is where quantum computing comes in.

Quantum has been around since the beginning of the twentieth century and has
been used to "explain everything that can't be explained". It has given us
"some of the strangest ideas humans have ever encountered" -- the idea that
physical objects can occupy several different states simultaneously, for
example.

Ladizinsky asks the audience to imagine that they had five minutes to find an
"X" he had written on a page of a book in the Library of Congress. You
wouldn't be able to do it, but if you were in 50 million parallel realities,
and in each you looked at several pages each, you would be able to. This would
be conditional of course on you being able to collaborate with your other
selves, in order to do it in an organised way, ensuring that one of you
definitely came up with the right answer.

"We call talking to your other selves coherent evolution. If they've all
talked to each other, one of them will have come across the answer. We can't
do this as humans, but we can do this in the lab now," he says. "It turns out
the world we live in is a very strange place. Physical systems can play out
the possibilities simultaneously, and those possibilities can talk to each
other."

While the point of quantum computing is that it can solve mysteries beyond
those that the human mind is capable of, building a quantum computer itself is
a mystery that is still being solved. Ladizinsky works for the company D-Wave,
which has already made huge leaps towards this, developing technology that is
now being used to search for exoplanets, among other things. While the work is
far from over, Ladizinsky is hopeful.

"I think we're at a tipping point -- we've been on a Moore's Law-like
trajectory." It might not be long until quantum is at a stage when it could
prove itself "the unimaginable computing power that might be realised in every
section of science", he says.
