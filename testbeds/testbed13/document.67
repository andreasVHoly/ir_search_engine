In room-size metal boxes ­secure against electromagnetic leaks, the National
Security Agency is racing to build a computer that could break nearly every
kind of encryption used to protect banking, medical, business and government
records around the world.

According to documents provided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, the
effort to build “a cryptologically useful quantum computer” — a machine
exponentially faster than classical computers — is part of a $79.7 million
research program titled “Penetrating Hard Targets.” Much of the work is hosted
under classified contracts at a laboratory in College Park, Md.

The development of a quantum computer has long been a goal of many in the
scientific community, with revolutionary implications for fields such as
medicine as well as for the NSA’s code-breaking mission. With such technology,
all current forms of public key encryption would be broken, including those
used on many secure Web sites as well as the type used to protect state
secrets.

Physicists and computer scientists have long speculated about whether the
NSA’s efforts are more advanced than those of the best civilian labs. Although
the full extent of the agency’s research remains unknown, the documents
provided by Snowden suggest that the NSA is no closer to success than others
in the scientific community.

“It seems improbable that the NSA could be that far ahead of the open world
without anybody knowing it,” said Scott Aaronson, an associate professor of
electrical engineering and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.

The NSA appears to regard itself as running neck and neck with quantum
computing labs sponsored by the European Union and the Swiss government, with
steady progress but little prospect of an immediate breakthrough.

“The geographic scope has narrowed from a global effort to a discrete focus on
the European Union and Switzerland,” one NSA document states.

Seth Lloyd, an MIT professor of quantum mechanical engineering, said the NSA’s
focus is not misplaced. “The E.U. and Switzerland have made significant
advances over the last decade and have caught up to the U.S. in quantum
computing technology,” he said.

The NSA declined to comment for this article.

"If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum
mechanics," said the late Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, widely regarded as
the pioneer in quantum computing. The science video blog Vertiasium tries to
help make sense of it.

The documents, however, indicate that the agency carries out some of its
research in large, shielded rooms known as Faraday cages, which are designed
to prevent electromagnetic energy from coming in or out. Those, according to
one brief description, are required “to keep delicate quantum computing
experiments running.”

computing efforts] _

****The basic principle underlying quantum computing is known as “quantum superposition,” the idea that an object simultaneously exists in all states. A classical computer uses binary bits, which are either zeroes or ones. A quantum computer uses quantum bits, or qubits, which are simultaneously zero and one. 

This seeming impossibility is part of the mystery that lies at the heart of
quantum theory, which even theoretical physicists say no one completely
understands.

“If you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don’t understand quantum
mechanics,” said the late Nobel laureate Richard Feynman, who is widely
regarded as the pioneer in quantum computing.

Here’s how it works, in theory: While a classical computer, however fast, must
do one calculation at a time, a quantum computer can sometimes avoid having to
make calculations that are unnecessary to solving a problem. That allows it to
home in on the correct answer much more quickly and efficiently.

Quantum computing is difficult to attain because of the fragile nature of such
computers. In theory, the building blocks of such a computer might include
individual atoms, photons or electrons. To maintain the quantum nature of the
computer, these particles would need to be carefully isolated from their
external environments.

“Quantum computers are extremely delicate, so if you don’t protect them from
their environment, then the computation will be useless,” said Daniel Lidar, a
professor of electrical engineering and the director of the Center for Quantum
Information Science and Technology at the University of Southern California.

A working quantum computer would open the door to easily breaking the
strongest encryption tools in use today, including a standard known as RSA,
named for the initials of its creators. RSA scrambles communications, making
them unreadable to anyone but the intended recipient, without requiring the
use of a shared password. It is commonly used in Web browsers to secure
financial transactions and in encrypted ­e-mails. RSA is used because of the
difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers. Breaking the
encryption involves finding those two numbers. This cannot be done in a
reasonable amount of time on a classical computer.

In 2009, computer scientists using classical methods were able to discover the
primes within a 768-bit number, but it took almost two years and hundreds of
computers to factor it. The scientists estimated that it would take 1,000
times longer to break a 1,024-bit encryption key, which is commonly used for
online transactions.

A large-scale quantum computer, however, could theoretically break a 1,024-bit
encryption much faster. Some leading Internet companies are moving to
2,048-bit keys, but even those are thought to be vulnerable to rapid
decryption with a quantum computer.

Quantum computers have many applications for today’s scientific community,
including the creation of artificial intelligence. But the NSA fears the
implications for national security.

“The application of quantum technologies to encryption algorithms threatens to
dramatically impact the US government’s ability to both protect its
communications and eavesdrop on the communications of foreign governments,”
according to an internal document provided by Snowden.

Experts are not sure how soon a quantum computer would be feasible. A decade
ago, some experts said that developing a large quantum computer was likely 10
to 100 years in the future. Five years ago, Lloyd said the goal was at least
10 years away.

Last year, Jeff Forshaw, a professor at the University of Manchester, told
Britain’s Guardian newspaper, “It is probably too soon to speculate on when
the first full-scale quantum computer will be built but recent progress
indicates that there is every reason to be optimistic.”

“I don’t think we’re likely to have the type of quantum computer the NSA wants
within at least five years, in the absence of a significant breakthrough maybe
much longer,” Lloyd told The Washington Post in a recent interview.

Some companies, however, claim to already be producing small quantum
computers. A Canadian firm, D-Wave Systems , says it has been making quantum
computers since 2009. In 2012, it sold a $10 million version to Google, NASA
and the Universities Space Research Association, according to news reports.

That quantum computer, however, would never be useful for breaking public key
encryption like RSA.

“Even if everything they’re claiming is correct, that computer, by its design,
cannot run Shor’s algorithm,” said Matthew Green, a research professor at the
Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute, referring to the
algorithm that could be used to break encryption like RSA.

Experts think that one of the largest hurdles to breaking encryption with a
quantum computer is building a computer with enough qubits, which is difficult
given the very fragile state of quantum computers. By the end of September,
the NSA expected to be able to have some building blocks, which it described
in a document as “dynamical decoupling and complete quantum ­control on two
semiconductor qubits.”

“That’s a great step, but it’s a pretty small step on the road to building a
large-scale quantum computer,” Lloyd said.

A quantum computer capable of breaking cryptography would need hundreds or
thousands more qubits than that.

The budget for the National Intelligence Program, commonly referred to as the
“black budget,” details the “Penetrating Hard Targets” project and noted that
this step “will enable initial scaling towards large systems in related and
follow-on efforts.”

Another project, called “Owning the Net,” is using quantum research to support
the creation of quantum-based attacks on encryptions like RSA, documents show.

“The irony of quantum computing is that if you can imagine someone building a
quantum computer that can break encryption a few decades into the future, then
you need to be worried right now,” Lidar said.
