#  What is superposition?

What do ripples on puddles, waves on ropes and noise-cancelling headphones
have in common?

They all show **superposition**. When two waves meet they overlap and
interact. Sometimes they add to make a wave bigger, sometimes they cancel each
other out, and often it's a combination of both. Noise-cancelling headphones
listen to regular and constant noise around you and play the exact opposite
sound to cancel annoying noises like jet planes engines.

This phenomenon is known as **superposition**.

Confusingly, however, in the quantum world **superposition** can mean
something different entirely. At the quantum scale, particles can also be
thought of as waves. Particles can exist in different states, for example they
can be in different positions, have different energies or be moving at
different speeds. But because quantum mechanics is weird, instead of thinking
about a particle being in one state or changing between a variety of states,
particles are thought of as existing across all the possible states at the
same time. It's a bit like lots of waves overlapping each other. This
situation is known as a **superposition** of states. If you're thinking in
terms of particles, it means a particle can be in two places at once. This
doesn't make intuitive sense but it's one of the weird realities of quantum
physics.

However, once a measurement of a particle is made, and for example its energy
or position is known, the **superposition** is lost and now we have a particle
in one known state.
