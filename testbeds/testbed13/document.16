# USRA quantum computing request for proposals

Posted on January 18, 2016 by  Geordie

The Universities Space Research Association (USRA) is pleased to invite
proposals for Cycle 2 of the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
Research Opportunity, which will allocate computer time for research projects
to be run on the D-Wave 2X system at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) for the
time period October 2015 through September 2016.

The total allocated computer time for the research opportunity represents
approximately 20% of the total available runtime during the period. Successful
projects will be allowed to remotely access the quantum computer, and to run a
number of jobs up to a maximum allocated runtime usage.

The Call is open to all qualified researchers affiliated to accredited
universities, not-for-profit organizations, and industry. Exceptions to
researchers unaffiliated with universities might be considered in case of
proposals of outstanding quality and the desire to publish the results of the
investigation. The computer time will be provided free of charge. No financial
support is offered for the completion of the project.

Proposals are sought for research on artificial intelligence algorithms and
advanced programming (mapping, decomposition, embedding) techniques for
quantum annealing, with the objective to advance the state-of-the-art in
quantum computing and its application to artificial intelligence.

The D-Wave 2X machine currently features the "Washington" chip. High-level
descriptions of the computer and its programming can be found on D-Wave
website http://www.dwavesys.com/resources/tutorials. The specific machine
installed at ARC currently has 1,097 qubits in the working graph, and this is
planned to be upgraded in the future as new processors become available.

A number of published research papers documenting the use of D-Wave processors
or discussing its applications can be found at
http://www.usra.edu/quantum/bibliography.

Applications received by October 31, 2015 will be given full consideration.
The call for proposals will remain open after this date, and applications
received after this date will also be considered, in USRA's sole discretion.

# Degeneracy, degree, and heavy tails in quantum annealing

Andrew D. King, Emile Hoskinson, Trevor Lanting, Evgeny Andriyash, Mohammad H.
Amin

(Submitted on 23 Dec 2015)

> Both simulated quantum annealing and physical quantum annealing have shown
the emergence of "heavy tails" in their performance as optimizers: The total
time needed to solve a set of random input instances is dominated by a small
number of very hard instances. Classical simulated annealing, in contrast,
does not show such heavy tails. Here we explore the origin of these heavy
tails, which appear for inputs with high local degeneracy--large isoenergetic
clusters of states in Hamming space. This category includes the low-precision
Chimera-structured problems studied in recent benchmarking work comparing the
D-Wave Two quantum annealing processor with simulated annealing. On similar
inputs designed to suppress local degeneracy, performance of a quantum
annealing processor on hard instances improves by orders of magnitude at the
512-qubit scale, while classical performance remains relatively unchanged.
Simulations indicate that perturbative crossings are the primary factor
contributing to these heavy tails, while sensitivity to Hamiltonian
misspecification error plays a less significant role in this particular
setting.

# Announcing the D-Wave 2X

Posted on August 20, 2015 by  Geordie

We are very excited to announce the general availability of the latest
generation of D-Wave quantum computers, the D-Wave 2X™ system.  With 1000+
qubits and many other technological advancements, the D-Wave 2X will enable
customers to run much larger, more complex problems on the system.

Here is a press release describing the system, and here is a paper describing
benchmarking results performed on it.

Here is one, in the Burnaby lab.

Seeing the D-Wave facilities first-hand is a very cool experience. They look a
lot like computers did back in the 60s. There are a lot of parallels to back
then -- we even built our own version of Spacewar! -- except you get to play
against a quantum computer. (Aside: this game -- which was the world's first
quantum computer game -- was called MaxCat. I own the only handwritten copy of
the rules…. one of my most treasured artifacts!)

Here's the first part of a series showing what you'd see if you visited
D-Wave's main experimental facility. Shot by D-Wave's Dom Walliman --
experimental physicist, author, and videographer extraordinaire, and starring
Jeremy Hilton, D-Wave's VP of Processor Development. Hope you like it!
