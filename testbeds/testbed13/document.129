Best Answer:  They are very fundamentally different. A super computer is
simply a fast regular (or classical) computer. It can do the sorts of things
that a classical computer can, it just has a faster processor or (more
processors), so it does it faster.  
  
A quantum computer, on the other hand, handles information in a different way.
Instead of being restricted to simple 0's or 1's of classical computers (bits)
they have the ability to work with 0's, 1's, and 0's AND 1's AT THE SAME TIME.
This ability to have a bit be both 0 and 1 simultaneously requires
superposition, which is a phenomena at the heart of quantum mechanics. This
ability also gives quantum computers a kind of massive multiparallelism that
is not achievable for classical computers. In fact, 300 quantum bits (or
qubits) have the ability to be in more states simultaneously then there are
atoms in the universe. However, despite all this massive multiparallelism,
there is a big problem with quantum computers, and that is the read out or
measurement of qubits. This kind of destroys the functional advantage of
multiparallelism for all but a few types of problems. That is to say quantum
computers are only good at a very small number of problems, the main ones
being factoring and unstructured search. For almost all other problems
(addition, graphics, etc) a classical computer will be as good as a quantum
computer. But for these few problems that are better on quantum computers, it
is important to point out that the benefit is not in the operating speed. A
quantum computer is not intrinsically faster at computing, the operations are
no faster (and probably quite a bit slower). The reason a quantum computer is
better is simply because it is more efficient, meaning that for really big
problems that take many operations to solve, a classical computer would take
many many more operations than a quantum computer would on these few select
problems. Therefore, even though a quantum computer does not manipulate
information any faster, since it requires less steps in solving the problem,
it can solve problems faster overall.  
  
And there is another problem with quantum computers. They are very hard to
make. No one has made a useful quantum computer to date, and we are probably
decades away from having a useful quantum computer (if we ever will).  
  
So the overall answer to your question is that right now, supercomputers are
much faster and they exist. In several decades, we may have a quantum
computer. That quantum computer will never replace a super computer because
there are many (most) types of problems that a super computer will be able to
do better. But for a few types of problems (factoring) a quantum computer will
require so many fewer steps to solve that it will beat the pants off the super
computer. But again, only for those very specific types of problems.  
  
By the way, factoring is an important problem because our public key
cryptosystems are based on the inability of classical computers to efficiently
factor large numbers. If you had a quantum computer that can efficiently
factor large numbers, you could break those cryptosystems. That means that it
would no longer be safe to send you credit card number on an encrypted lie
over the internet and that top secret communications between government
entities would no longer be secure. So obviously there are lots of people who
want quantum computers.
