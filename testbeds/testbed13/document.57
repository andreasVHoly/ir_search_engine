IBM on Wednesday opened its quantum computer processor to anyone who wants to
try what is expected to be a new kind of computing with enormously improved
power and speed.

The cloud-based computing system will allow users to explore the technology,
which scientists say may solve certain problems that are impossible to solve
on today's supercomputers.

"This moment represents the birth of quantum cloud computing," said Arvind
Krishna, senior vice president and director at IBM Research.

"Quantum computers are very different from today's computers, not only in what
they look like and are made of, but more importantly in what they can do.
Quantum computing is becoming a reality and it will extend computation far
beyond what is imaginable with today's computers."

The company said anyone can run experiments on the computing platform by
accessing its website connected to the IBM Cloud.

Quantum computing, an area of research for a number of big tech firms, differs
from traditional digital computing due to the physics in which the computing
device handles a calculation.

Unlike conventional or digital computers, quantum computers use quantum bits
or "qubits" that can exist in multiple states simultaneously, offering the
potential to compute a large number of calculations all at once, speeding up
results.

While quantum computing is still in its infancy, scientists believe it could
lead to huge improvements in artificial intelligence, transform materials
science and allow for search or analysis of vastly larger quantities of data
than can be handled by today's most powerful machines.

IBM said its quantum processor housed at its Watson Research Center is a first
step toward building a universal quantum computer with far greater potential.

The company received a research grant last year from the US Intelligence
Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA) to advance the building blocks for
a universal quantum computer.

Roger Kay, an analyst at Endpoint Technologies Associates, said IBM's new
machine is a relatively primitive quantum computer as it develops more refined
models.

At some point, Kay said, a quantum computer could analyze as many potential
scenarios "as there are stars in the universe," which could open up new
avenues for research and other computing fields.

With that amount of computing power, Kay said, "decryption becomes almost
trivial," and that government agencies could be able to deal with encryption
used by criminals and others.

"The public should be concerned because your stuff can be decrypted too," Kay
said.

But he noted that "the quantum computing era is still a decade away."
