This month, Google made a big announcement about their latest machine, “The
Quantum Computer”. This device is the fastest computer in the world with 100
million times faster speed than today’s generations of computers (PC). This
will be a big leap in all industrial fields because not only this project can
enhance the whole human informational system, but it can also revolutionize
and change technologies where ultra-computing is vital.

### Let us start with the basic. What is quantum computing?

> “_A quantum computer taps directly into the fundamental fabric of reality –
the strange and counter-intuitive world of quantum mechanics_” – D-wave

The computer is using a quantum bit and replaced the traditional “bit system”
that is commonly used in digital communication. A quantum bit or qubits exist
in a state of superposition, which can process both state of 0 and 1 (binary)
at the same time unlike with traditional computer, binary instructions were
processed one at a time.

This significant advantage brought by the qubit system can be easily
capitalized because it can accept computing challenges that are beyond the
reach of current conventional systems. This breakthrough can further enhance
space travel exploration, medical research in gene therapy, artificial
intelligence and a lot more.

> “_Quantum annealing can offer run-time advantages for hard optimization
problems characterized by rugged energy landscapes._”

Hartmut Neven, the director of the Engineering Department, explains that for
problems more than 1000 binary variables, quantum computing does a much better
job than classic computing. Quantum computers where simulated on conventional
processors, but compared to these, new the quantum hardware still works 108
times faster.

### Who started this revolution?

Quantum computing was first theorized by a physicist named Richard Freyman in
1982. He foreseen the emergence of computers which use a quantum bit system.
The promising views of Freyman are currently happening when a new era of
ultra-powered computers are built to enhance our living.

### When this project happened?

A company called D-wave, based in Canada, is the pioneer on this field. Google
was able to provide partnership to help them in their research and
development. Actually, D-wave didn’t build a quantum computing rig; instead
they built a system that can simulate a quantum annealer.

Quantum annealer is a higher-level procedure used for finding some global
extrema (maximum and minimum) of any given objective function, over a
prearranged candidate solution by a process called quantum fluctuations. If
you wish to know more about quantum annealing additional information can be
found here:

### D-wave System: The quest for more qubits

D-wave started this project way back in April 2003 where they successfully
completed the first quantum annealer that has a 1 qubit processor. In March
2004, a 2 qubit quantum annealer is completed and eventually doubled its power
every year. This year, a 1000 qubit processor named “D-wave 2x” is released to
the public and was able to get a deal with NASA. The federal agency wants to
install a D-Wave 2X system in their supercomputer laboratory located in Silver
Valley, Idaho USA for research and testing purposes.

### D-wave 2x system benchmarking

After testing the D-wave 2x System, astounding result struck their research
and development team. Here’s how it performed:

1\. The D-Wave 2X near-optimal solutions is up to 15x faster than the
conventional solvers using total time measurements.

2\. The D-Wave 2X optimal test results shows a near-optimal solution in the
middle of 2 to 600 times faster processing speed depending on its load or
input. The comparison test also uses the quantum anneal time of the D-Wave
processor.

3\. Technically, the variance between “optimal” and “near-optimal” is quite
small, which is usually less than one percent. The D-Wave 2X is up to 100x
faster at finding good near-optimal solutions than optimal solutions.

4\. The utmost performance benefit for the D-Wave 2X compared to its test
competitor, the software solvers, are detected on their inputs that has more
interesting structures rather than simple random cases that have been the
major focus on its previous performance tests. Meaning, D-Wave 2X’s hardware
is showcasing its finest performance against the software solvers on hard
problem occurrences.

D-Wave System raised up a $29 million investment bonds this January. The
company didn’t disclose its major investors' information. Their previous
investors are Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Goldman Sachs.

Despite the success of D-wave, there are a lot of rumors and arguments buzzing
around, saying that the company does not represent a true quantum computing
system though the test results showed a valid evidence of entanglement. This
only means that the test result is a manifestation of a quantum computer. The
main function of this computer is for solving optimization problems, but it
can’t be used for a general computing for now.

Recent major purchases are from technology giants such as Google, NASA and
Lockheed Martin, a well-known defense contractor of US Defense Department
developing new technologies for military hardware.

### How much would it cost for a full Quantum Computer system installation?

The whole package of the system’s installation is a whopping $15 million which
includes a specialist’s service fee for installing the system. If you were
Bill Gates, would you buy a quantum system?

Our today’s advancement in technology brought better gadgets, machines and
tools to improve our lives. However, everything has a price. As the features
go higher, so do the costs. Unlike others, we see these technology
improvements as long term investments. Since our world is running in a faster
speed, there is a higher chance that these investments won’t stay up for long.
As people keep on finding ways to build better and faster technology, would
you take that leap of investing millions for a quantum system? Sound it in the

We, GizmoSnack, have partnered with Amazon.com, for a number of reasons. For
starters, you can in fact find in many cases, **very good deals** for the
products you are looking for. Moreover, Amazon hosts a large community of
reviewers. People review the things they buy. Transparency is important, and
Amazon makes sure to provide a solid framework for maintaining it.

Another good reason to buy from Amazon is that manufacturers often offer
discounts, organize daily deals and from time to time, do clearances. Many
legitimate sellers are the producers themselves, so there's no additional cost
with the distribution. However, we encourage you to pay attention from whom
you buy: inspect the reputation of the seller and always look to the shipping
costs before actually making the purchase.

Last but not least, Amazon's return policy is outstanding, and their customer
service is flawless. If you buy a gizmo and you're not happy with the product,
you can return it, in most cases, no questions asked.
