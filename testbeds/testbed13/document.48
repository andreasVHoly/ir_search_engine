# Quantum Computing - RFP

###### Research Area(s):

Quantum Computing, Computer Science & Information Technology  
  
**Description:**  
  
The Universities Space Research Association (USRA) is pleased to invite
proposals for Cycle 2 of the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Laboratory
Research Opportunity, which will allocate computer time for research projects
to be run on the D-Wave System at NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) for the time
period October 2015 through September 2016.  
  
The total allocated computer time for the research opportunity represents
approximately 20% of the total available runtime during the period. Successful
projects will be allowed to remotely access the quantum computer, and to run a
number of jobs up to a maximum allocated runtime usage.  
  
The Call is open to all qualified researchers affiliated to accredited
universities, not-for-profit organizations, and industry. Exceptions to
researchers unaffiliated with universities might be considered in case of
proposals of outstanding quality and the desire to publish the results of the
investigation. The computer time will be provided free of charge. No financial
support is offered for the completion of the project.  
  
Proposals are sought for research on artificial intelligence algorithms and
advanced programming (mapping, decomposition, embedding) techniques for
quantum annealing, with the objective to advance the state-of-the-art in
quantum computing and its application to artificial intelligence.  
  
The D-Wave 2X machine currently features the "Washington" chip. High-level
descriptions of the computer and its programming can be found on the D-Wave
website http://www.dwavesys.com/resources/tutorials. The specific machine
installed at ARC currently has 1097 qubits in the working graph, and this is
planned to be upgraded in the future as new processors become available.  
  
A number of published research papers documenting the use of D-Wave processors
or discussing its applications can be found at
http://www.usra.edu/quantum/bibliography  
  
Applications are currently accepted, and will be given full consideration. For
