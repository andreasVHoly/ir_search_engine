##  Classical vs. Quantum Computers

This section introduces the most basic differences between classical and
quantum computers in a phenomenologic manner. For a more rigid and formal
explanation, please refer to section 2.

###  Quantum Bits

In a classical computer, the logical state is determined by the expectation
value of its register contents (e.g. tension of a capacitor). The
interpretation as (classical) bits is performed by comparing the measured
value to a defined threshold, while the great number of particles guarantees
that the uncertainty of the measurement is small enough to make errors
practically impossible.

In a quantum computer, information is represented as the common quantum state
of many subsystems. Each subsystem is described by a combination of two
``pure'' states interpreted as  and  (quantum bit, qubit). This can e.g. be
realised by the spin of a particle, the polarisation of a photon or by the
ground state and an excited state of an ion.

For a single qubit, this state can be described by the complex amplitudes  and
of each of the two states (  ) with the condition .

It is obvious, that this interpretation stands in contradiction to classic
boolean logic, where intermediate states between 0 and 1 are not possible.

###  Entanglement of States

The logical state of a classical register is determined by the states of all
bits this register contains. Those bits can be changed locally i.e.
independently form one another. The state of an  bit register, can therefore
be described by  binary values.

A quantum register containing more than one qubit can not be described by
simply listing the states of each qubit, moreover it is not even possible to
define the state of an isolated qubit:

Given an isolated system of two qubits, its state can be described by four
complex amplitudes  . You can define the expectation value for the first
qubit, which is  but there is no isolated state for the first qubit anymore
like e.g.  since  does not implicate that  .

Therefore, manipulations on a single qubit effect the complex amplitudes of
the overall state and have a global character. To describe the combined state
of  entangled qubits,  complex numbers are necessary.

###  Measurement

In a classical computer, the formal description of the inner state and the
measurement of this state (i.e. the output of the program) is the same and
given by the binary values of the concerned bits. Moreover, the inner state is
not effected by the process of measurement (non destructive measurement).

According to the Kopenhagner interpretation of quantum physics, the outcome of
measurements on quantum systems (qubits) must be formulated in classical terms
(binary bits). The quantum state of the system is thereby reduced: If the
first bit in the above mentioned 2 qubit state is measured, and a value of 1
is observed, then the state will be reduced to  with  , thus all basevectors
which 0 in the first bit (  and  ) will be set to an amplitude of zero.

Therefore it is principally not possible to measure the state of a quantum
register itself; it is however possible, to estimate the expectation value of
a qubit by repeated measurements after the same calculation.

###  
Reversibility of Computation

Heat dissipation is one of the major problems with the miniaturisation of
classical computers and constant cooling of all components is required. This
is achieved by the thermic coupling of the circuits to a heat reservoir like
e.g. the surrounding air.

For a quantum computer, cooling by heat coupling is no option since its
logical state is directly represented by the common quantum state of its
registers. Any heat coupling would necessarily result in the entanglement of
this state with the outside world and destroy the coherence of the
computation.

The second law of thermodynamics postulates that any non-reversible state
change of a system must dissipate heat. Many common logical operations like
AND, OR or resetting a bit to 0 or 1 are non-reversible is the sense that the
input cannot be calculated from the output. Therefore, these operations cannot
directly be implemented in a quantum computer.
