You've heard plenty of people by now—including us—banging on about quantum
computers, and how they’re the future of high-performance computing. Quantum
computing, we're meant to understand, is set to change the world. But despite
its promise, it's neither widely available nor particularly useful yet. Here's
why not.

### Basic Bits

First things first, a quick reminder of exactly what a quantum computer is.
Essentially, they’re computers that make use of quantum physics. Unlike a
normal digital systems which rely on data encoded into binary digits
(bits)—that can only ever take the form of 0 or 1—quantum computation uses
quantum properties to represent data and perform operations.

A quantum computer, then, uses not bits but qubits (quantum bits). Each of its
qubits can represent a 0, a 1, or—crucially—anything in between.

Imagine a table covered in coins. In a classical computer, each one is either
showing a head or tail; in a quantum computer, a coin could be showing 25
percent head and 75 percent tail, or any other position between the two
possible states. Once measured, of course—and we have Schroedinger to thank
for this—it assumes one of the two states, heads or tails.

Because each qubit can assume such a wide range of values, a modest number of
them can hold an insane quantity of information; this is what lends quantum
computers their theoretical grunt. Just 100 qubits can store
1,267,650,600,228,229,401,496,703,205,375 different numbers—many trillion
times the storage capacity of all computers _ever made_. In other words, 100
qubits can simultaneously represent all possible 100-bit numbers in their huge
quantum state, as opposed to a classical 100-bit computer, which can represent
just one.

It’s that vast ability to assume many states at once that—in theory—means that
quantum computers can provide untold power, many times faster than any
classical computer. In practice, it's rather more difficult.

### Building Blocks

First off, building a quantum computer is no mean feat. While the technology
required to create computers full of traditional bits is well established,
manufacturing qubits is far from straightforward.

For starters, no one is quite sure what the best way to make one is. Some
techniques involve trapping ions, electrons or other tiny little particles;
some propose using superconductors to create microscopic quantum circuits;
others suggest it might be possible to use photons and complex optical
apparatus to achieve a similar goal. What these techniques all have in common,
however, is the fact that they’re currently plausible on the small scale but
incredibly difficult to realize on the large. Essentially, that limits quantum
computers to research machines, at least for now.

The scaling problem itself is a result of quantum decoherence—or, rather,
wanting to eliminate it. The problem is that, as good ol’ Schroedinger was
only too keen to point out, quantum systems need to be isolated from the rest
of world in order to work. Interactions with the external world cause the
system to decohere, collapsing down and taking a binary state, just like a
normal computer.

But the very guts of a quantum computer—quantum gates, lattice vibrations,
background nuclear spin of the qubits—can all introduce decoherence effects,
too. The solution? Decide on an error rate—the amount of dechorence you’re
happy for the system to put up with—and design for that.

Even that's an imperfect solution, though; to have an error rate small enough
that you're still getting the benefits of a respectable quantum computer,
you’d need a weighty bump in the number of qubits to provider error
correction, and those qubits are extremely difficult to produce in the first
place, which… well, you can see where that goes.

### You’re a User, Baby

Let's say, though, that you're able to build a functional quantum computer
(not surprisingly, Google's on it). While you might think that having all that
raw, pulsating computational power at your fingertips might be a dream come
true, in reality using the damn thing is close to nightmarish.

First, there’s the question of knowing if it’s even working in the first
place. A widely known tenet of quantum mechanics is that merely observing the
phenomenon changes the outcome of an event. So, watch a quantum particle, or a
qubit, or anything quantum for that matter, and you change its behavior. That
means that it’s actually very difficult to tell if a quantum computer is
behaving in the way we’d expect or need it to.

In fact, the currently available so-called quantum computers aren’t actually
verified to be working the way they're supposed to. They’re simply based on
the right theory, some fingers crossing, and judged by their output.

That raises a whole other set of issues. Specifically, actually attaining that
output is a mess. Coding a quantum computer is no mean feat; by their very
nature, they give answers that are necessarily probabilistic, not concrete.
For many solutions, that means that the answer isn’t necessarily bang on at
first attempt; instead, the same calculation has to be repeated a number of
times before the obvious correct answer emerges. In turn this means that,
depending on the type of problem, there isn’t necessarily a huge amount of
advantage in using a quantum computer compared to a regular one.

it. Even the lamest… Read more Read more

It's possible to exploit some of the mystical magical power of quantum
mechanics to improve the speed with which solutions are reached, but so far
researchers have only managed to do it for a very small set of problems, like
finding the prime factors of very large numbers. That’s neat—and, it turns
out, useful for cryptography—but it’s certainly limited.

### Two Wrongs Don’t Make a Right

Here’s the real kicker, though. Despite all that computational grunt, all the
blood, sweat, and tears building and coding the damn thing, it’s not even
necessarily possible to tell if a quantum computer produces the right answer
in the end. Say what?

A quantum computer could, in theory, be used to calculate solutions in days,
maybe even hours, that would take a normal computer thousands of years to
produce. While some of the answers its spits out are verifiable—a complex
cryptographic key generated by a quantum computer is testable by using it and
checking it by encrypting and decrypting a message, for instance—there are
others that can’t be tested. Simply put, quantum computers are often used to
solve the types of problems for which we have no other confirmation mechanism.
We often can't double check their work.

There may, however, be a way around this. A team of scientists from the
University of Vienna have developed a technique call “blind quantum computing”
that it believes could help. The idea’s quite straightforward; it involves
mathematical traps, essentially intermediate steps in a calculation, which
humans—or at least other computers—definitely _can_ work out in advance. If
those answers come out incorrect, then the overall answer must contain an
error, too. Instead of checking the final solution, it keeps an eye out for
problem spots along the way.

In Nature Physics, the researchers have demonstrated that the technique can at
least work on a small scale, using a four-qubit quantum computer as a verifier
to test against a second quantum computer. They even claims that it’s
scalable, and could be used on computers with hundreds of qubits. But, like
all things in quantum computing, there’s a snag. "Like almost all current
quantum computing experiments, this currently has the status of a fun
demonstration proof of concept, rather than anything that's directly useful
yet,” explained computer scientist Scott Aaronson at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, to Science.

And that, right there, demonstrates why quantum computing remains little more
than a lusty dream. At least for now.
