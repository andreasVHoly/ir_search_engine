# Google's Quantum Computer Just Got a Big Upgrade

D-Wave's quantum chip.  Google

Google is upgrading its quantum computer. Known as the D-Wave, Google's
machine is making the leap from 512 qubits--the fundamental building block of
a quantum computer--to more than a 1000 qubits. And according to the company
that built the system, this leap doesn't require a significant increase in
power, something that could augur well for the progress of quantum machines.

Together with NASA and the Universities Space Research Association, or USRA,
Google operates its quantum machine at the NASA Ames Research center not far
from its Mountain View, California headquarters. Today, D-Wave Systems, the
Canadian company that built the machine, said it has agreed to provide regular
upgrades to the system--keeping it "state-of-the-art"--for the next seven
years. Colin Williams, director of business development and strategic
partnerships for D-Wave, calls this "the biggest deal in the company's
history." The system is also used by defense giant Lockheed Martin, among
others.

Though the D-Wave machine is less powerful than many scientists hope quantum
computers will one day be, the leap to 1000 qubits represents an exponential
improvement in what the machine is capable of. What is it capable of? Google
and its partners are still trying to figure that out. But Google has said it's
confident there are situations where the D-Wave can outperform today's non-
quantum machines, and scientists at the University of Southern California have
published research suggesting that the D-Wave exhibits behavior beyond
classical physics.

Over the life of Google's contract, if all goes according to plan, the
performance of the system will continue to improve. But there's another
characteristic to consider. Williams says that as D-Wave expands the number of
qubits, the amount of power needed to operate the system stays roughly the
same. "We can increase performance with constant power consumption," he says.
At a time when today's computer chip makers are struggling to get more
performance out of the same power envelope, the D-Wave goes against the trend.

### The Qubit

A quantum computer operates according to the principles of quantum mechanics,
the physics of very small things, such as electrons and photons. In a
classical computer, a transistor stores a single "bit" of information. If the
transistor is "on,” it holds a 1, and if it’s "off," it holds a 0. But in
quantum computer, thanks to what’s called the superposition principle,
information is held in a quantum system that can exist in two states _at the
same time_. This "qubit" can store a 0 and 1 simultaneously.

Two qubits, then, can hold four values at any given time (00, 01, 10, and 11).
And as you keep increasing the number of qubits, you exponentially increase
the power of the system. The problem is that building a qubit is a extreme
difficult thing. If you read information from a quantum system, it
"decoheres." Basically, it turns into a classical bit that houses only a
single value.

D-Wave believes it has found a way around this problem. It released its first
machine, spanning 16 qubits, in 2007. Together with NASA, Google started
testing the machine when it reached 512 qubits a few years back. Each qubit,
D-Wave says, is a superconducting circuit--a tiny loop of flowing current--and
these circuits are dropped to extremely low temperatures so that the current
flows in both directions at once. The machine then performs calculations using
algorithms that, in essence, determine the probability that a collection of
circuits will emerge in a particular pattern when the temperature is raised.

### Reversing the Trend

Some have questioned whether the system truly exhibits quantum properties. But
researchers at USC say that the system appears to display a phenomenon called
"quantum annealing" that suggests it's truly operating in the quantum realm.
Regardless, the D-Wave is not a general quantum computer--that is, it's not a
computer for just any task. But D-Wave says the machine is well-suited to
"optimization" problems, where you're facing many, many different ways forward
and must pick the best option, and to machine learning, where computers teach
themselves tasks by analyzing large amount of data.

D-Wave says that most of the power needed to run the system is related to the
extreme cooling. The entire system consumes about 15 kilowatts of power, while
the quantum chip itself uses a fraction of a microwatt. "Most of the power,"
Williams says, "is being used to run the refrigerator." This means that the
company can continue to improve its performance without significantly
expanding the power it has to use. At the moment, that's not hugely important.
But in a world where classical computers are approaching their limits, it at
least provides some hope that the trend can be reversed.
