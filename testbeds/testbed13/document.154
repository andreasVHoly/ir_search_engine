Part of the Computing fundamentals glossary:

Quantum computing is the area of study focused on developing computer
technology based on the principles of quantum theory, which explains the
nature and behavior of energy and matter on the quantum (atomic and subatomic)
level. Development of a quantum computer, if practical, would mark a leap
forward in computing capability far greater than that from the abacus to a
modern day supercomputer, with performance gains in the billion-fold realm and
beyond. The quantum computer, following the laws of quantum physics, would
gain enormous processing power through the ability to be in multiple states,
and to perform tasks using all possible permutations simultaneously. Current
centers of research in quantum computing include MIT, IBM, Oxford University,
and the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

The essential elements of quantum computing originated with Paul Benioff,
working at Argonne National Labs, in 1981. He theorized a classical computer
operating with some quantum mechanical principles. But it is generally
accepted that David Deutsch of Oxford University provided the critical impetus
for quantum computing research. In 1984, he was at a computation theory
conference and began to wonder about the possibility of designing a computer
that was based exclusively on quantum rules, then published his breakthrough
paper a few months later. With this, the race began to exploit his ideas.
However, before we delve into what he started, it is beneficial to have a look
at the background of the quantum world.

#### Quantum Theory

Quantum theory's development began in 1900 with a presentation by Max Planck
to the German Physical Society, in which he introduced the idea that energy
exists in individual units (which he called "quanta"), as does matter. Further
developments by a number of scientists over the following thirty years led to
the modern understanding of quantum theory.  


#### The Essential Elements of Quantum Theory:

  * Energy, like matter, consists of discrete units, rather than solely as a continuous wave.
  * Elementary particles of both energy and matter, depending on the conditions, may behave like either particles or waves.
  * The movement of elementary particles is inherently random, and, thus, unpredictable.
  * The simultaneous measurement of two complementary values, such as the position and momentum of an elementary particle, is inescapably flawed; the more precisely one value is measured, the more flawed will be the measurement of the other value.

#### Further Developments of Quantum Theory

Niels Bohr proposed the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum theory, which
asserts that a particle is whatever it is measured to be (for example, a wave
or a particle) but that it cannot be assumed to have specific properties, or
even to exist, until it is measured. In short, Bohr was saying that objective
reality does not exist. This translates to a principle called superposition
that claims that while we do not know what the state of any object is, it is
actually in all possible states simultaneously, as long as we don't look to
check.

To illustrate this theory, we can use the famous and somewhat cruel analogy of
Schrodinger's Cat. First, we have a living cat and place it in a thick lead
box. At this stage, there is no question that the cat is alive. We then throw
in a vial of cyanide and seal the box. We do not know if the cat is alive or
if it has broken the cyanide capsule and died. Since we do not know, the cat
is both dead and alive, according to quantum law - in a superposition of
states. It is only when we break open the box and see what condition the cat
is in that the superposition is lost, and the cat must be either alive or
dead.

The second interpretation of quantum theory is the _multiverse_ or _many-
worlds_ theory. It holds that as soon as a potential exists for any object to
be in any state, the universe of that object transmutes into a series of
parallel universes equal to the number of possible states in which that the
object can exist, with each universe containing a unique single possible state
of that object. Furthermore, there is a mechanism for interaction between
these universes that somehow permits all states to be accessible in some way
and for all possible states to be affected in some manner. Stephen Hawking and
the late Richard Feynman are among the scientists who have expressed a
preference for the many-worlds theory.

Which ever argument one chooses, the principle that, in some way, one particle
can exist in numerous states opens up profound implications for computing.

#### A Comparison of Classical and Quantum Computing

Classical computing relies, at its ultimate level, on principles expressed by
Boolean algebra, operating with a (usually) 7-mode logic gate principle,
though it is possible to exist with only three modes (which are AND, NOT, and
COPY). Data must be processed in an exclusive binary state at any point in
time - that is, either 0 (off / false) or 1 (on / true). These values are
binary digits, or bits. The millions of transistors and capacitors at the
heart of computers can only be in one state at any point. While the time that
the each transistor or capacitor need be either in 0 or 1 before switching
states is now measurable in billionths of a second, there is still a limit as
to how quickly these devices can be made to switch state. As we progress to
smaller and faster circuits, we begin to reach the physical limits of
materials and the threshold for classical laws of physics to apply. Beyond
this, the quantum world takes over, which opens a potential as great as the
challenges that are presented.  
  
The Quantum computer, by contrast, can work with a two-mode logic gate: XOR
and a mode we'll call QO1 (the ability to change 0 into a superposition of 0
and 1, a logic gate which cannot exist in classical computing). In a quantum
computer, a number of elemental particles such as electrons or photons can be
used (in practice, success has also been achieved with ions), with either
their charge or polarization acting as a representation of 0 and/or 1. Each of
these particles is known as a quantum bit, or qubit, the nature and behavior
of these particles form the basis of quantum computing. The two most relevant
aspects of quantum physics are the principles of superposition and
_entanglement_ .

#### Superposition

Think of a qubit as an electron in a magnetic field. The electron's spin may
be either in alignment with the field, which is known as a _spin-up_ state, or
opposite to the field, which is known as a _spin-down_ state. Changing the
electron's spin from one state to another is achieved by using a pulse of
energy, such as from a laser \- let's say that we use 1 unit of laser energy.
But what if we only use half a unit of laser energy and completely isolate the
particle from all external influences? According to quantum law, the particle
then enters a superposition of states, in which it behaves as if it were in
both states simultaneously. Each qubit utilized could take a superposition of
both 0 and 1. Thus, the number of computations that a quantum computer could
undertake is 2^n, where n is the number of qubits used. A quantum computer
comprised of 500 qubits would have a potential to do 2^500 calculations in a
single step. This is an awesome number - 2^500 is infinitely more atoms than
there are in the known universe (this is true parallel processing - classical
computers today, even so called parallel processors, still only truly do one
thing at a time: there are just two or more of them doing it). But how will
these particles interact with each other? They would do so via quantum
entanglement.  
  
**Entanglement** Particles (such as photons, electrons, or qubits) that have interacted at some point retain a type of connection and can be entangled with each other in pairs, in a process known as _correlation_ . Knowing the spin state of one entangled particle - up or down - allows one to know that the spin of its mate is in the opposite direction. Even more amazing is the knowledge that, due to the phenomenon of superpostition, the measured particle has no single spin direction before being measured, but is simultaneously in both a spin-up and spin-down state. The spin state of the particle being measured is decided at the time of measurement and communicated to the correlated particle, which simultaneously assumes the opposite spin direction to that of the measured particle. This is a real phenomenon (Einstein called it "spooky action at a distance"), the mechanism of which cannot, as yet, be explained by any theory - it simply must be taken as given. Quantum entanglement allows qubits that are separated by incredible distances to interact with each other instantaneously (not limited to the speed of light). No matter how great the distance between the correlated particles, they will remain entangled as long as they are isolated.  
  
Taken together, quantum superposition and entanglement create an enormously
enhanced computing power. Where a 2-bit register in an ordinary computer can
store only one of four binary configurations (00, 01, 10, or 11) at any given
time, a 2-qubit register in a quantum computer can store all four numbers
simultaneously, because each qubit represents two values. If more qubits are
added, the increased capacity is expanded exponentially.

#### Quantum Programming

Perhaps even more intriguing than the sheer power of quantum computing is the
ability that it offers to write programs in a completely new way. For example,
a quantum computer could incorporate a programming sequence that would be
along the lines of "take all the superpositions of all the prior computations"
- something which is meaningless with a classical computer - which would
permit extremely fast ways of solving certain mathematical problems, such as
factorization of large numbers, one example of which we discuss below.  
  
There have been two notable successes thus far with quantum programming. The
first occurred in 1994 by Peter Shor, (now at AT&amp;T Labs) who developed a
quantum algorithm that could efficiently factorize large numbers. It centers
on a system that uses number theory to estimate the periodicity of a large
number sequence. The other major breakthrough happened with Lov Grover of Bell
Labs in 1996, with a very fast algorithm that is proven to be the fastest
possible for searching through unstructured databases. The algorithm is so
efficient that it requires only, on average, roughly N square root (where N is
the total number of elements) searches to find the desired result, as opposed
to a search in classical computing, which on average needs N/2 searches.

#### The Problems - And Some Solutions

The above sounds promising, but there are tremendous obstacles still to be
overcome. Some of the problems with quantum computing are as follows:

  * Interference - During the computation phase of a quantum calculation, the slightest disturbance in a quantum system (say a stray photon or wave of EM radiation) causes the quantum computation to collapse, a process known as de-coherence. A quantum computer must be totally isolated from all external interference during the computation phase. Some success has been achieved with the use of qubits in intense magnetic fields, with the use of ions.
  * Error correction - Because truly isolating a quantum system has proven so difficult, error correction systems for quantum computations have been developed. Qubits are not digital bits of data, thus they cannot use conventional (and very effective) error correction, such as the triple redundant method. Given the nature of quantum computing, error correction is ultra critical - even a single error in a calculation can cause the validity of the entire computation to collapse. There has been considerable progress in this area, with an error correction algorithm developed that utilizes 9 qubits (1 computational and 8 correctional). More recently, there was a breakthrough by IBM that makes do with a total of 5 qubits (1 computational and 4 correctional).
  * Output observance - Closely related to the above two, retrieving output data after a quantum calculation is complete risks corrupting the data. In an example of a quantum computer with 500 qubits, we have a 1 in 2^500 chance of observing the right output if we quantify the output. Thus, what is needed is a method to ensure that, as soon as all calculations are made and the act of observation takes place, the observed value will correspond to the correct answer. How can this be done? It has been achieved by Grover with his database search algorithm, that relies on the special "wave" shape of the probability curve inherent in quantum computers, that ensures, once all calculations are done, the act of measurement will see the quantum state decohere into the correct answer.

Even though there are many problems to overcome, the breakthroughs in the last
15 years, and especially in the last 3, have made some form of practical
quantum computing not unfeasible, but there is much debate as to whether this
is less than a decade away or a hundred years into the future. However, the
potential that this technology offers is attracting tremendous interest from
both the government and the private sector. Military applications include the
ability to break encryptions keys via brute force searches, while civilian
applications range from DNA modeling to complex material science analysis. It
is this potential that is rapidly breaking down the barriers to this
technology, but whether all barriers can be broken, and when, is very much an
open question.
