# Google, NASA: Our quantum computer is 100 million times faster than a normal
PC

## But only for very specific optimisation problems.

D-Wave's latest quantum chip, with around 1,152 usable qubits.

D-Wave

Two years ago Google and NASA went halfsies on a D-Wave quantum computer,
mostly to find out whether there are actually any performance gains to be had
when using quantum annealing instead of a conventional computer. Recently,
Google and NASA received the latest D-Wave 2X quantum computer, which the
company says has "over 1000 qubits."

At an event yesterday at the NASA Ames Research Center, where the D-Wave
computer is kept, Google and NASA announced their latest findings—and for
highly specialised workloads, quantum annealing does appear to offer a truly
sensational performance boost. For an optimisation problem involving 945
binary variables, the D-Wave X2 is up to 100 million times faster (108) than
the same problem running on a single-core classical (conventional) computer.

Google and NASA also compared the D-Wave X2's quantum annealing against
Quantum Monte Carlo, an algorithm that emulates quantum tunnelling on a
conventional computer. Again, a speed-up of up to 108 was seen in some cases.

simulated quantum computing algorithms. At the high end (far right) the
difference is on the order of 108.

Time to good-enough is a better measure than time-to-perfect.

Hartmut Neven, the head of Google's Quantum Artificial Intelligence lab, said
these results are "intriguing and very encouraging" but that there's still
"more work ahead to turn quantum enhanced optimization into a practical
technology."

As always, it's important to note that D-Wave's computers are not capable of
universal computing: they are only useful for a small number of very specific
tasks—and Google, NASA, and others are currently trying to work out what those
tasks might be. D-Wave’s claim of "over 1,000 qubits" is also unclear. In the
past, several physical qubits were clustered to create a single computational
qubit, and D-Wave doesn’t make that distinction clear.

We will publish a further, in-depth report about Google and NASA's latest
findings in the next few weeks.
