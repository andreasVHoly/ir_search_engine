NASA's Quantum Artificial Intelligence Laboratory supports an array of
fundamental and experimental studies that could lead to ground-breaking
research, resulting in revolutionary advances to the state-of-the-art in
quantum computing.

## Algorithms

One of the central open questions in the field of quantum computing is the
existence of efficient quantum heuristic algorithms for solving classically
intractable instances of combinatorial optimization problems that are found at
the core of many of NASA's missions. Classical heuristic algorithms have been
developed over the years to solve or approximate solutions to practical
instances of hard problems, and the search for improved heuristics remains an
active research area. The efficacy of these approaches is generally determined
by running them on benchmark sets of problem instances. Such empirical testing
for quantum algorithms requires the availability of quantum hardware. As that
hardware becomes available, NASA's QuAIL team will, beginning with the D-Wave
Twoâ„¢ quantum-annealing machine, design and evaluate quantum approaches to
challenging combinatorial optimization problems.

Initial efforts will focus on theoretical and empirical analysis of quantum
annealing approaches to difficult optimization problems. The team's work
includes the development of quantum AI algorithms, problem decomposition and
hardware embedding techniques, and quantum-classical hybrid algorithms.

## Quantum Noise

One main area of focus is adiabatic quantum computation. The team is
particularly interested in understanding how the effects of noise, imprecision
in the Hamiltonian coefficients, and thermal processes affect adiabatic
quantum computation and measurement precision. Particularly for high-
dimensional optimization problems, where the optimal solution is represented
by the lowest point on a highly featured landscape of hills and valleys,
researchers are exploring how the shape of the landscape affects how quickly
that lowest point may be found using quantum annealing algorithms.

## Quantum Metrology

Metrology is the science of measurement. It encompasses time and clock
standards, distance measurements, orientation and navigation, electromagnetic
and gravitational field detection, and determination of physical constants.
This research is of fundamental importance to the field of physics, since it
involves the scrutiny of exactly how we observe and interact with nature. It
is also of great significance for NASA, as quantum metrology has implications
for improved space sensors and telescopes, and superior inertial navigation
for future spacecraft.

Quantum metrology is concerned with harnessing quantum many-body correlations
and entanglement for the purposes of enhancing measurement sensitivity past
the classical bounds. This classical bound is easily defined for a many-body
system containing N particles: In this case the precision sensitivity (the
variance on any estimate of the parameter being investigated) scales with the
inverse square root of the particle number. This is exactly the precision
limit resulting from making N independent single particle measurements of the
parameter. So any greater sensitivity implies that the device is operating
beyond this classical limit, and that the particles are behaving in a quantum-
correlated fashion.

The QuAIL team aims to model real quantum measurement devices and to explore
in a realistic setting what sort of quantum probe states of light, spin
systems or atom ensembles may access this new domain of parameter super-
sensitivity.

## Potential Applications

NASA is exploring the potential of quantum computing--and quantum annealing
algorithms in particular--to aid in the many challenging computational
problems involved in NASA missions.

One initial target application area the QuAIL team will be exploring is
related to the NASA Kepler mission's search for habitable, Earth-sized
planets. The complex computational task of identifying and validating the
transit signals of smaller planets as they orbit their host stars is currently
based on heuristic algorithms (designed to find approximate solutions when
classic methods don't find exact solutions), implying that some planets could
remain undiscovered due to this computational limitation. Using a quantum
computer to perform Kepler's data-intensive search for transiting planets
among the more than 150,000 stars in the spacecraft's field of view has the
potential to provide a unique, complementary approach to the task of
discovering potential new Earth-like exoplanets.

Another early target application area the team will explore is in the area of
planning and scheduling. Determining the very best use of limited resources
during space missions--such as time and power--can require hours, days or even
weeks to solve with classical algorithms. Automated planners have their
origins in robotics and have been used extensively in space applications.
Examples of such applications developed at NASA Ames include automated
planners for the ongoing Mars Curiosity mission and software that helps
optimize operations of the International Space Station's solar arrays. NASA
researchers are mapping planning problems from a variety of areas, including
planetary rover exploration, to forms suitable to be run on quantum computing
systems.
