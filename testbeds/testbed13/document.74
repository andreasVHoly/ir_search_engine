# Scientists Create a 5-atom Quantum Computer That Could Make Today's
Encryption Obsolete

_ __ NOVA _

##### In Brief

MIT scientists have developed a 5-atom quantum computer, one that is able to
render traditional encryption obsolete.

##### A new Computer

Researchers from MIT say that they have developed the world’s first five-atom
quantum computer, and they assert that it is capable of cracking today’s
traditional encryption methods—today's most notable encryption methods.

To break this down a bit, in computing, numbers are traditionally binary
(represented by 0 and 1). However, in quantum computing, these units are known
as "qubits," which are in a state of superposition, being _simultaneously_ 0
and 1. This opens a number of doors in relation to computing and encryption.

This is just a very basic overview, the video below delves into the workings
and purposes a bit deeper.

Now then, because of the way that the computer functions, it typically takes
about 12 qubits to factor the number 15. What researchers at MIT and the
University of Innsbruck, Austria have done is bring that number down to just 5
qubits, with each qubit represented by one atom.

But perhaps what it most notable about all this is that the system will
feature scalability, allowing more atoms and lasers to be added. This is
important, as it is the use of laser pulses that stabilizes the quantum system
and holds atoms in an ion trap. So in short, the scalability will enable the
building of bigger and faster quantum computers, ones that can factor much
larger numbers.

##### Making a 5 Atom Computer

The creation of this five atom quantum computer comes in response to a
challenge posed in 1994 by Professor Peter Shor of MIT. Professor Shor
developed a quantum algorithm that’s able to calculate a large number’s prime
factors more efficiently than traditional computers, with 15 being the
smallest figure to meaningfully demonstrate the algorithm.

The new system was able to return the correct factors and with a confidence
upwards of 99 percent.

Professor Isaac Chuan of MIT said: “We show that Shor’s algorithm, the most
complex quantum algorithm known to date, is realizable in a way where, yes,
all you have to do is go in the lab, apply more technology, and you should be
able to make a bigger quantum computer.”

Of course, this may be a little easier said than done. “It might still cost an
enormous amount of money to build—you won’t be building a quantum computer and
putting it on your desktop anytime soon—but now it’s much more an engineering
effort, and not a basic physics question,” Chuang added.

Yet, Chuang has his team are hopeful for the future of quantum computing,
saying that they “foresee it being straightforwardly scalable, once the
apparatus can trap more atoms and more laser beams can control the pulses…We
see no physical reason why that is not going to be in the cards.”

Their findings have been published in the  journal _Science_.

_This article has been updated to better reflect the specific kinds of
encryption that this development relates to._
