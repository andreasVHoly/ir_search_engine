# The Dawn of Quantum Computing is Upon Us

In 1981, at a conference co-organized by MIT and IBM, the famously brilliant
and irreverent physicist Richard Feynman urged the world to build a quantum
computer. He said "Nature isn't classical, dammit, and if you want to make a
simulation of nature, you'd better make it quantum mechanical, and by golly
it's a wonderful problem, because it doesn't look so easy."

Quantum theory was a revolutionary advance in physics and chemistry in the
early 20th century, an elegant mathematical theory that explained the bizarre
behavior of subatomic particles, and led to great technological advances such
as the laser and transistor. But only in the last decade of the 20th century
was it realized that quantum theory applies not only to atoms and molecules,
but to bits and logic operations in a computer.

Now, in the 21st century, this realization is bringing about a revolution in
the science and technology of information processing, making possible kinds of
computing and communication unforeseen by the founders of the information
revolution. But to explore and develop these possibilities, we will need to
learn how to build a quantum computer, that is to say a device able to store
and process this delicate new form of information as reliably and smoothly as
an ordinary computer manipulates its bits.

Until now only a privileged group of scientists and innovators have had access
to the engineering and hardware needed to build a quantum computer. That’s why
today we’re opening up our advanced quantum processor to not just the
scientific community, but the general public, providing access to a quantum
computing platform from any desktop or mobile device via the cloud.

This is a seminal moment in computing. When we look back years from now, I
believe we will see today as the beginning of the road to a truly practical
quantum computer, which, when it’s built, will be one of the greatest
milestones in the history of information technology.

Today we’re laying the foundation by inviting anyone interested to create
algorithms and run experiments on IBM’s quantum processor, play with
individual quantum bits (qubits), learn about quantum computing through
tutorials and simulations, and get inspired by the possibilities of a quantum
computer.

One reason for building quantum computers is that some problems are known to
be solvable exponentially faster on them than on any classical computer. For
other problems, of more general application, the known speedup is quadratic,
still dwarfing any mere multiplicative improvement in classical technology.
These known speed-ups are what is what has ignited interest in, and a race to
build, a universal quantum computer.

Beyond mere problem-solving, quantum versions of the Internet and of cloud
computing can give users the confidence, based on laws of physics rather than
unproven mathematical conjectures, that their data remains private and secure.
Another promising area is quantum simulation—by working the way nature does,
quantum computers raise the hope of understanding chemical and biological
processes, and materials of all sorts, better than any classical simulation
can.

For still other problems, in machine learning and big data, quantum algorithms
have been proposed that might offer a significant advantage, though it is too
early to tell. But the most important reason for developing quantum computing
is that it is so new, and so radically different from conventional information
processing, that it would be foolhardy to think we can accurately foresee what
it is good for. It must be explored to see what we find out.

We want to expose the advances we’ve made because to really use a quantum
computer it requires that we think differently. The intuition we have in the
classical computing world does not apply in a quantum mechanical one, so the
idea of sharing our current capabilities will let the scientific community and
public start to understand and develop a new way of thinking – or think
quantum.

**Building a quantum system**

Whether you’re a student, developer, quantum physicist or general science
enthusiast, anyone in the world can explore and run experiments and create
their own innovations on IBM Research’s five qubit quantum system. By doing
so, we believe we will accelerate progress and discover new applications
across fields such as drug discovery, quantum chemistry, machine learning and
many more.

Quantum computing has bits, just like any computer. But instead of ones and
zeros, its quantum bits, or qubits, can represent a one, a zero, or both at
once, which is a phenomenon known as superposition. However, the superposition
that occurs in a quantum computer is very different than any conventional
computer – it allows two or more qubits to behave in a coordinated way that
cannot be explained by supposing each is doing its own thing. This is called
entanglement, and it’s what gives a quantum computer its uncanny power.
Quantum thinking will allow us to re-imagine computing that can solve some
problems too hard for conventional computers, and do things with information
no one thought possible.

IBM’s team’s latest engineering advances include combining five
superconducting qubits in a latticed arrangement on a chip’s circuit design,
and demonstrating a key operation known as a parity measurement – the basis of
many quantum error correction protocols – to give users opportunities for
reliably high-quality performance and speed-up.

As with any feat, there are many challenges to building a practical quantum
computer, including preserving the very fragile state of quantum information.
Any kind of coupling with the outside world threatens to disturb and destroy
it. But if you isolate a quantum processor entirely, it cannot compute because
you cannot send signals in and out. This delicate balance is the reason we
have to cool our superconducting qubits to temperatures within a few
thousandths of a degree of absolute zero – something we’re still mastering.

The theory of quantum information science had been well developed and there
had been some practical demonstrations of quantum principles, but we’ve
reached a turning point where the blend between science and engineering is
starting to result in physical systems that can scale up. In fact, there’s
been more progress made in the field in the last five years than there’s been
in the last 20 years.

Only a year ago we showed the ability to detect and measure two kinds of
quantum errors simultaneously, as well as demonstrated a new qubit circuit
design that could successfully scale to create large chips capable of powering
computers. Building a universal quantum computer hinges on these milestones.

We’re also pleased to share our quantum computing breakthroughs with the IBM
Research Frontiers Institute, a new consortium we have created to explore how
the physical sciences will shape the future of information technology. As part
of that, we have a program called Quantum Leaps that gives members early
access to computing breakthroughs, including our quantum computing advances.

Today we're at the threshold of doing what Feynman presciently asked 35 years
ago. As Feynman predicted, it wasn't easy, but along the way, we've rebuilt
our whole theory of information and information processing on a deeper
foundation. And the best rewards are yet to come.
