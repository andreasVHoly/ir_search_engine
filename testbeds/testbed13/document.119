# How to Fight a War With a Quantum Computer

The Australian Government recently announced plans to invest $26 million in
the development of quantum computing technology as part of the National
Innovation and Science Agenda (NISA). Prime Minister Turnbull has argued that
NISA is part of a new “ideas boom” designed to “create a modern, dynamic and
21st century economy for Australia.” It emphasizes quantum computing as an
important area for government investment based on its ability to produce “jobs
and economic growth.” And while this industry could certainly be “worth
billions,” it offers much more than financial prosperity: quantum technologies
could play a significant role in our future defense and security.

Quantum technology harnesses the obscure properties of subatomic matter to
achieve computing processes unobtainable with classic computers. Today’s
computers run on binary digits, or bits, which exist as either 1s or 0s. In
contrast, quantum bits, or qubits, exploit the bizarre principle of
superposition that enables them to occupy all possible states (both 1 and 0)
at the same time. This allows quantum computers to undertake multiple
calculations in parallel, unlocking unprecedented processing power that could
“solve problems that would take conventional computers centuries.”

Another important quantum quality, entanglement, means two qubits can become
inextricably linked, such that a change in one causes a change in the other.
The qubits can remain connected even when separated across large distances.
This delicate connection can be used for instantaneous communication, and its
vulnerability to interference means the act of eavesdropping fundamentally
alters the transmission, rendering it provably secure.

NISA asserts that those technological tricks will have a “transformational
impact on Australian and global businesses” but fails to mention the
revolutionary role they could play in improving Australia’s defense force in
three key areas.

The ability of quantum computers to undertake multiple calculations at once
makes them an enormous asset for the optimization of defense logistics. A
quantum computer could examine all possible strategies and quickly identify
the most rapid or low-energy solution, in order to determine the military’s
preferable travel path, which is likely to increase the efficiency and speed
of military operations.

Increasingly complex weapons systems also rely on ever-growing volumes of
activation software. For example, the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter now requires
more than twenty million lines of code to be fully operational. The brute
force of quantum computers could offer a strategic advantage by improving the
efficiency of code validation where defense assets are deployed in time-
sensitive scenarios.
