# If I'm interested in quantum computing, should I major in Computer Science
or Physics?

My current goal is to major in Computer Engineering with a possible minor in
Physics, and then get a masters in Physics. How realistic is this to work in
quantum computing?

You should major in Computer *Science* or Physics, but not Computer
Engineering.  If you major in CS you should take lots of Theoretical Computer
Science Courses (Discrete math, combinatorics, Algorithms, Computational
Complexity, etc.)  Which one you major in depends on whether you are more
interested in developing the theory of quantum computing, e.g. trying to
understand what sort of problems quantum computers are good for solving, or
actually trying to build them.  
  
Unlike the other responders, I would not say that physics is obviously the
best choice.  I have worked in several academic institutions with quantum
computing groups and the split between people with a physics or a CS/math
background is roughly 50/50.  If you come via a CS route you will definitely
end up doing theoretical work because there aren't actually any full scale
quantum computers for you to play with yet.  If you do physics you can end up
doing theory or experiment.  There are a large number of experimental groups
in physics, so I don't know why so many of the other responses say you can
only do theory.  It is, however, true that the experiments involve
manipulating a small number of qubits, so they can't really be called full-
blown quantum computers at this stage.  Physicists also do theoretical work,
but typically of a different sort to computer scientists.  They try to figure
out new ways of building quantum computers, apply ideas from quantum
information to other fields of physics, and work on the foundations of quantum
theory.  Computer scientists are more likely to be found working on quantum
algorithms and complexity, although several groups now do semantics,
programming languages, logics and things like that as well.  
  
Having said all that, it doesn't matter too much what you major in right now.
It matters much more what you do your Ph.D. in.  I know several former physics
undergrads who did Ph.D.s in quantum computing in computer science departments
and vice versa.  It is not so hard to pick up the missing bits of knowledge
that you need.

Quantum Computation.

As Joshua Engel notes, this point in time, quantum computing is an academic
pursuit. There is no industry to work for, with the exception of a single
venture funded company that may or may not still be around when you graduate.
This means that to pursue an interest in quantum computing, you should be
excited about a career doing scientific research. A masters degrees will not
suffice -- you will eventually need to get a PhD.  
  
Quantum computing is an interdisciplinary field with contributions from
physicists, computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians and even chemists
(such as my adviser). Researchers in quantum computing come from all these
backgrounds, so there are many paths you could take to be successful. I am
really excited about quantum computing research, but it is a specialized
enough sub-field of academia that I think it would be a mistake to choose your
undergraduate major entirely for this reason. If you major in any of these
related fields, it will be possible for you to make a transition into quantum
computing.  
  
That said, the optimal background to choose as a future quantum computing
researcher depends on your interests. If you are most interested in developing
quantum computing algorithms in an abstract sense, I would pick theoretical
computer science or mathematics. If you want to work on physical
implementations (either experimentally or theoretically), then you should do
physics or possibly a closely related engineering field. Theoretical
physicists often work on more abstract aspects as well, but usually in a more
applied way than the computer scientists. Either way, take all the courses you
can on quantum mechanics and theoretical computer science.  
  
Realistically, there is significantly more work being done on implementations
than algorithms. So a physics degree as an undergraduate is probably the
easiest route to working in this field. It probably also preserves the
greatest number of options (in the field of quantum computing), since you can
later choose to go take more or less applied routes.

I concur with the others: physics.  
  
There's not much overlap between computer engineering and the current state of
quantum computing.  Quantum computing isn't done in a fab plant; it's done
with paper and pencil.  The quantum devices that are built look more like
physics equipment than like computers.  
  
Only one company is even claiming to make a quantum computer, and it's not at
all clear that this is what they're actually doing.  
  
For everybody else, quantum computing is a blackboard exercise, not a computer
engineering task.  And that blackboard exercise requires an extensive
background in quantum mechanics that you're not going to get in a computer
engineering class.  Actually developing a quantum computer will require even
more background in experimental physics, the kind you'll get in a master's
degree.  
  
It will be hard to get into a master's degree program without an undergrad
physics degree.  It does happen, but it will require a lot of outside work.

It depends. I took my university's quantum computing course last year, and it
was in the Engineering department but largely involved physics (and some
computer science). You can really go either way with it: there are a ton of
engineering challenges with implementing the things, and a lot of active
research that will probably become really big in our lifetimes. There's also a
ton of theoretical work that will never involve implementation and which
requires a really solid grasp of quantum mechanics and high-level math. I
think it really depends on whether physics or engineering is more your thing.  
  
I'd suggest physics because it's my major, but... I'm biased.  
  
  
My class was largely engineers, who are as capable of learning quantum
mechanics as physicists are once in graduate school, though I'm certain we
physics majors have had longer exposure to it.  
Note also that quantum computing is very much a subject of graduate-level
work. I asked my professor about undergraduate opportunities and he said that
that was very unrealistic; it requires a lot of theoretical background. A
masters in physics might work if you get in a research group for quantum
computing by then, but don't expect to get a masters in physics and then go
find a job in quantum computing somewhere; it is largely an academic field at
the moment.

I would vote for physics. I assume that you know enough computer tech already
to understand the basics in the state of the art. In order to design new
hardware, on logic that will be needed for Quantum computing you will need to
be a great physicist.
