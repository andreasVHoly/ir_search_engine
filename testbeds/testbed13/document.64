# Quantum Computers: The End of Cryptography?

Quantum computing is one of those technologies that’s so arcane that TV
characters name drop it when they want to sound smart.

Quantum computing as an idea has been around for a while — the theoretical
possibility was originally introduced by Yuri Manin and Richard Feynman in
1982.  Over the last few years, though, the field has been edging worryingly
closer to practicality.

Companies like Google and Microsoft, as well as government agencies like the
NSA have all been feverishly pursuing quantum computers for years now.  A
company called D-Wave has produced and is selling devices that (while they
aren’t proper computers, and can only perform a few algorithms) exploit
quantum properties, and are another incremental step on the road toward a
fully Turing-complete quantum machine.

It doesn’t seem unreasonable to say that breakthroughs might occur that will
allow the first large-scale quantum computer to be built within a decade.

So why all the interest?  Why should you care?  Computers get faster all the
time – what’s so special about quantum computers?

In order to explain why these machines are so important, we’re going to have
to take a step back and explore exactly what quantum computers are, and why
they work.  To start off, let’s talk about a concept called “runtime
complexity.”

## What is Runtime Complexity?

One of the big surprises in the early days of computer science was the
discovery that, if you have a computer that solves a problem of a certain size
in a certain amount of time, doubling the speed of the computer does not
necessarily let it tackle problems twice as big.

Some algorithms increase in total execution time very, very quickly as the
size of the problem grows – some algorithms can be rapidly completed given 100
data points, but completing the algorithm given 1000 data points would require
a computer the size of the Earth running for a billion years.  Runtime
complexity is a formalization of this idea: it looks at the curve of how fast
the complexity of a problem grows, and uses the shape of that curve to
classify the algorithm.

Generally, these classes of difficulty are expressed as functions.  An
algorithm that gets proportionately harder when the data set its working on
increases (like a simple counting function) is said to be a function with a
runtime complexity of “**n”** (as in, it takes **n** units of time to
process** n** data points).

Alternately, it might be called “linear”, because when you graph it, you get a
straight line.  Other functions might be **n^2** or** 2^n** or **n! **(n
factorial).  These are polynomial and exponential.  In the latter two cases,
the exponential ones grow so quickly that in almost all cases they can’t be
solved for anything except very trivial examples.

## Runtime Complexity and Cryptography

If you’re hearing this stuff for the first time and it sounds meaningless and
arcane, let’s try to ground this discussion.  Runtime complexity is critical
for cryptography, which relies on making decryption much easier for people who
know a secret key than for those who don’t.  In an ideal cryptographic scheme,
decryption should be linear if you have the key, and **2^k** (where k is the
number of bits in the key) if you don’t.

In other words, the best algorithm for decrypting the message without the key
ought to be simply guessing possible keys, which is intractable for keys only
a few hundred bits long.

For symmetric key cryptography (in which the two parties have the chance to
exchange a secret securely before they start communication) this is pretty
easy.  For asymmetric cryptography, it’s harder.

Asymmetric cryptography, in which the encryption and decryption keys are
different and can’t be easily computed from one another, is a much harder
mathematical structure to implement than symmetric cryptography, but it’s also
a lot more powerful: asymmetric crypto lets you have private conversations,
even over tapped lines!  It also allows you to create “digital signatures” to
allow you to verify who a message came from, and that it hasn’t been tampered
with.

These are powerful tools, and make up the foundation of modern privacy:
without asymmetric cryptography, users of electronic devices would have no
reliable protection against prying eyes.

Because asymmetric cryptography is harder to build than symmetric, the
standard encryption schemes that are in use today are not as strong as they
could be: the most common encryption standard, RSA, can be cracked if you can
efficiently find the prime factors of a very large number.  The good news is
that that’s a very hard problem.

The best known algorithm for factoring large numbers into their component
primes is called the general number field sieve, and has a runtime complexity
that grows a little slower than **2^n**.  As a consequence, keys have to be
about ten times longer in order to provide similar security, which is
something that people normally tolerate as a cost of doing business.  The bad
news is that the entire playing field changes when quantum computers get
thrown into the mix.

## Quantum Computers: Changing the Crypto Game

Quantum computers work because they can have multiple internal states at the
same time, through a quantum phenomenon called “superposition”.  That means
that they can attack different parts of a problem simultaneously, split across
possible versions of the universe.  They can also be configured such that the
branches that solve the problem wind up with the most amplitude, so that when
you open the box on Schrodinger’s cat, the version of the internal state that
you’re most likely to be presented with is a smug-looking cat holding a
decrypted message.

For more information about quantum computers, check out our recent article on
the subject!

The upshot of this is that quantum computers aren’t just linearly faster, the
way normal computers are: getting two or ten or a hundred times faster doesn’t
help much when it comes to conventional cryptography that you’re hundreds of
billions of times too slow to process.  Quantum computers support algorithms
that have smaller-growing run time complexities than are otherwise possible.
This is what makes quantum computers fundamentally different from other future
computational technologies, like graphene and memrister computation.

For a concrete example, Shor’s Algorithm, which can only be executed on a
quantum computer, can factor large numbers in **log(n)^3** time, which is
drastically better than the best classical attack.  Using the general number
field sieve to factor a number with 2048 bits takes about 10^41 units of time,
which works out to more than a trillion trillion trillion.  Using Shor’s
algorithm, the same problem only takes about 1000 units of time.

The effect gets more pronounced the longer the keys are.  That’s the power of
quantum computers.

Don’t get me wrong – quantum computers have a lot of potential non-evil uses.
Quantum computers can efficiently solve the travelling salesman problem,
allowing researchers to build more efficient shipping networks and design
better circuits. Quantum computers already have powerful uses in artificial
intelligence.

That said, their role in cryptography is going to be catastrophic.  The
encryption technologies that allow our world to keep functioning depend on the
integer factorization problem being hard to solve.  RSA and related encryption
schemes are what let you trust you’re on the right website, that the files you
download aren’t riddled with malware, and that people aren’t spying on your
Internet browsing (if you’re using Tor).

Cryptography keeps your bank account safe and secures the world’s nuclear
infrastructure.  When quantum computers become practical, all of that
technology stops working.  The first organization to develop a quantum
computer, if the world still works on the technologies we use today, is going
to be in a frighteningly powerful position.

So, is the quantum apocalypse inevitable?  Is there anything we can do about
it?  As it turns out… yes.

## Post-Quantum Cryptography

There are several classes of encryption algorithms that, as far as we know,
are not significantly faster to solve on a quantum computer.  These are known
collectively as post-quantum cryptography, and provide some hope that the
world can transition to cryptosystems that will remain secure in a world of
quantum encryption.

Promising candidates include lattice-based encryption, like Ring-Learning With
Error, which derives its security from a demonstrably complex machine learning
problem, and multivariate cryptography, which derives its security from the
difficulty of solving very large systems of simple equations.  You can read
more about this topic on the Wikipedia article.  Beware: a lot of this stuff
is complex, and you may find that your mathematics background needs to be
beefed up considerably before you can really dig into the details.

The takeaway from a lot of this is that post-quantum cryptoschemes are very
cool, but also very young.  They need more work to be efficient and practical,
and also to demonstrate that they are secure.  The reason that we are able to
trust cryptosystems is because we’ve thrown enough clinically paranoid
geniuses at them for long enough that any obvious shortcomings would have been
discovered by now, and researchers have proved various characteristics that
make them strong.

Modern cryptography depends on light as a disinfectant, and most of the post-
quantum cryptographic schemes are simply too new to trust world security to.
They’re getting there, though, and with a little luck and some preparation,
security experts can complete the switch before the first quantum computer
ever comes on line.

If they fail, however, the consequences may be dire.  The thought of anyone
having that kind of power is unsettling, even if you’re optimistic about their
intentions.  The question of who first develops a working quantum computer is
one that everyone should watch very carefully as we move into the next decade.

"The best known algorithm for factoring large primes is called the general
number field sieve"

Sorry to be a smart alec, but you made the "Bill Gates" mistake!

Factoring primes is easy, the factorization of a prime is just itself and 1.
You mean factoring semiprimes, which is what RSA uses (the product of two
large primes).

Also, if a quantum computer is built, post-quantum cryptography does not
necessarily rescue cryptography . If someone proves P=NP, "we're all screwed"
!

Ooh, that's embarrassing! Fixed. In any case, if someone proves that P=NP,
we're screwed quantum computers or no. Bet you it doesn't, though.

What would be REALLY interesting is if someone comes up with a nonconstructive
proof that P=NP, so we all just sort of have to sit around hoping nobody can
figure it out.

A very Good article about Quantum Computers and its linking with the
cryptography. But I feel the article needs to be broken down into two or three
chunks so that it can be absorbed easily.
