_Futuristic technology is often framed in a 'doom to mankind' narrative. Brian
Cooper, CCO at UK-based independent agency_ _OLIVER Group, shares how the next
step in computing won't be a robotic coup, but an evolution that will empower
our work._

The computer chip has now reached middle age. Like most of us in middle age,
it is not as sprightly as it once was, and is set to be superseded by younger
forms of computing. Enter the quantum computer. It’s set to transform our
lives, the way we work and play.

# What exactly is quantum computing?

In a nutshell, conventional microprocessors are limited to binaries of ones
and zeros, which limits their processing capability. But quantum computers
hinge on the principles of quantum physics, which allows for something called
‘superimposition.' This means an electron can exist as a zero and one at the
same time, as opposed to either one or zero. This allows for levels of
processing power that are millions of times greater than we currently have.

Do we actually need all this speed? We do. Quantum computers promise vastly
enhanced processing power and memory, potentially millions of times more
powerful than today's fastest supercomputers. This will revolutionize the way
we interface with computers, and will thus have big implications for the
workplace.  
Additionally, Moore’s Law—the observation that computer processing power
doubles every two years—is seeing a significant slowdown. Intel’s chief
executive, Brian Krzanich, admits the manufacturer’s rhythm of innovation is
now closer to two and a half years than two. Even with the industry’s ever-
increasing R&amp;D spend of $56.4 billion in 2015, according to IC Insights,
the result is that conventional microprocessor technology is approaching a
fundamental limit of size, speed and cost.

# How can it change UI?

Today, we still use computers, including smartphones, like typewriters—sitting
in front of our screens carrying out time-consuming semi-mundane tasks. Scott
Jensen, a product strategist at Google, describes this as a Technological
Tiller, which is an old design put on a new technology. The term derived from
the use of boat tillers to steer the first cars. Grossly inefficient, these
were soon changed to steering wheels.

Voice is a far more efficient way of interfacing with a computer. With
conventional processing this has had a slow birth. Siri, the voice-recognition
system at the heart of the iPhone, is only really voice-activated search. But
with the power of quantum computing, what’s just over the horizon could be
more likened to the ship’s computer in _Star Trek_.

Siri’s co-founder Dag Kittlaus’ new venture Viv offers a real-life sign of
what’s to come. Like the grandmaster-beating AlphaGo, Viv learns as it goes
through reinforcement learning. But instead of complex strategy board games
such as Go or Atari computer games, Viv uses deep-learning to predict what the
user wants. Like the human brain, it constantly writes and rewrites its own
circuitry so that when you ask it a question it gives a meaningful answer.

Reinforcement learning is a form of AI more akin to what happens when you tell
a child what a chair looks like. By continually making the connection between
the word chair and an actual chair the child can start to recognize chairs for
itself. The reason that AI has taken so long to take off is due to the huge
processing power required to sift through the vast amounts of information to
make this sifting possible.

The power of quantum computers will be a huge boon to AI, and allow it to leap
to places even more extraordinary—and arguably more useful—than beating the
world champion at GO 4-1. AI together with natural language processing will
become the work horse of every backend system. With intelligent processing of
information we will merely need to voice our desires for the computer to
respond with the perfect answer. This is the equivalent change in the car from
a tiller to a steering wheel. Finally, the computer will get the interface it
deserves.

This shift in how information is inputted could start to have a bizarre affect
on how we communicate as individuals. Freed from the shackles of inefficient
keyboards we might all learn to communicate in-person again. We’ll think and
discuss more fluidly, without the interruption of an ever-filling inbox.
Quantum computers answering our emails won’t distract us. In fact, the
opposite will happen. They’ll empower us.

# What does this mean for the future of work?

AI-powered quantum computers will also change the way we work. They will
replace many jobs, which are not simple routine tasks. And whilst this may
seem a doom-laden future there are at least three good reasons to be
optimistic.

The most obvious is that computers will release us to be more creative.
Though, perfectly engineered to perform medical diagnosis, surgery and beat
grandmasters, robots are ultimately programmed by intelligent beings and set
clear goals. What they can’t do is come up with their own goals, their own
notions, their own ideas. This is the preserve of humans, and will make our
work more interesting.

History also shows that in the long run new technology creates more wealth and
more jobs. In the industrial revolution many jobs were replaced by machines.
But the wealth this created for its inventors created demand for other
products and service thus creating new jobs. Google DeepMind, the team behind
AlphaGo, has over 100 staff, all at work to create a winning machine.

Lastly, humans like to work. We shouldn’t forget the wisdom of Voltaire’s
Candide. After a lifetime fruitlessly traveling the world looking for the best
of all possible worlds he settled down on a farm concluding that work cures
three evils: boredom, poverty and vice.  
Quantum computing may change how we live and the nature of work, but it won’t
change what it is to be human. What we like to do and what we are good at
doing will always stay the same. How we we do it will change forever.
