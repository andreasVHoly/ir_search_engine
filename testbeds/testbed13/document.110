# Quantum computer finally proves its faster than a conventional PC, but only

A computer scientist at Amherst College has performed the first ever head-to-
head speed test between a conventional and quantum computer -- and, you'll be
glad to hear that the quantum computer won. But only just -- and against a
conventional computer that's 6,000 times cheaper.

The quantum computer being tested was the D-Wave Two, which packs 439 quantum
bits (qubits). Ever since D-Wave launched the first commercial quantum
computer in 2011 -- the 128-qubit, $10 million D-Wave One -- the company has
faced a lot of criticism from quantum physicists and computer scientists, who
claim that D-Wave's qubits aren't actually quantum. Over the last year or so,
thanks to peer-reviewed studies that have explored the D-Wave One's inner
workings, this criticism has faded.

This new study, from Catherine McGeoch of Amherst College, goes some way to
confirming the D-Wave Two's quantumness -- but at the same time, her research
shows that the D-Wave Two is nothing like the real, general-purpose quantum
computers that should revolutionize the world we live in. D-Wave's quantum
computers use quantum annealing (a type of adiabatic quantum computation) to
solve optimization problems -- and really, _only_ optimization problems. A
true quantum computer, however, should use quantum entanglement.

The D-Wave Two's cryogenic cooling system. There's a qubit chip in there,
somewhere.

As you probably know, quantum entanglement is incredibly finicky. The current
state of the art doesn't allow us to harness more than one or two entangled
qubits for a few microseconds. Quantum annealing, however, can be performed
with much noisier, lower-quality qubits -- which is why D-Wave has managed to
produce a 439-qubit system that works outside the lab, in a normal office
setting. D-Wave's qubit chips still need to be cooled to near-absolute-zero
(0.02K, -273.13C), though, and the qubits (loops of niobium) are still so
fickle (affected by external electromagnetic radiation) that each calculation
is carried out 1,000 times to ensure its accuracy. Despite all this, there's
still no guarantee that the final solution will be optimal (but it usually
is).

To perform the quantum vs. conventional computer speed test, three NP-hard
optimization problems were carried out on a variety of systems: A D-Wave Two
system containing a Vesuvius 5 chip (439 qubits), Blackbox (a Vesuvius
5/software hybrid), and three software solvers (CPLEX, METSlib Tabu, Akmaxsat)
running on an Intel Xeon E5-2690 CPU (under Ubuntu Linux 12.04). The best
example of NP-hard optimization is the traveling salesman problem, where you
must devise the shortest route between a given number of destinations. Such
optimization is computationally very difficult, but it's theorized that
quantum computers should be able to solve these problems much faster.

The results showed that, where the NP-hard problems could be executed directly
on the hardware, the D-Wave system is around 4,000 times faster. When Blackbox
had to be used, to break problems down into chunks that Vesuvius can
understand, performance tied or bettered the software solvers. The study also
briefly tested D-Wave's newest chip, the Vesuvius 6, and found that it would
be around 10,000 times faster than the software solvers.

These results probably pose more questions than they answer, though. We're
still not entirely sure how D-Wave's chips actually work, and so we have no
idea if we're using them optimally. We also don't know how the D-Wave chips
compare to software solvers that use highly optimized simulated quantum
annealing -- it's possible that the software would be just as fast as the
hardware. Finally, we must remember that the software was running on a ~$1500
workstation, while the D-Wave Two, which was recently purchased by Lockheed
Martin, has a price tag somewhere in the $10+ million range (6666 times more
expensive). You could build a petaflop-class supercomputer for $10 million --
and not only would it be faster than the D-Wave Two at NP-hard problems, but
you could run normal software on it, too!

For more information on the testing methodology, and some (mostly) human
readable background on what quantum annealing actually is, check out McGeoch's
research paper [PDF]. McGeoch will present "Experimental Evaluation of an
Adiabiatic Quantum System for Combinatorial Optimization" at the Association
for Computing Machinery (ACM) International Conference on Computing Frontiers
next week, in Italy.

And to think that they had me sitting here thinking that a quantum computer
that did anything awesome, was coming to my office. Ha! I'd be better off
buying 6,000 PCs because then I wouldn't need liquid nitrogen to cool it.

Just like mainframes PC's, it will take a while before they get from the full
room size to the PC size. And also 1000x cheaper.

You've just shown me how few people actually understand how progress really
works.

With that many computers packed in the same office, you *will* need nitrogen
cooling.

I suppose both you guys are right.

Yeah, you guys are right.

Not liquid nitrogen. That isn't anywhere near cold enough. You need almost
absolute zero for this to work; waaaayyyy colder than liquid Nitrogen.

You can argue about speed up, benchmarks, or if we have sufficient  
equipment to accurately test the d-wave. All spin aside, NASA now has  
an A. I. that is directly experiencing the Multiverse. Exciting times  
for science for sure.

I don't think anyone expects this technology to be readily available nor cost
effective for quite some time. It took decades for conventional computers to
make their way from being unwieldly room-sized operations that required teams
of technicians to single user workstations. It will take more time and way
more research and funding.

D-wave can double the number of qubits every year. That makes it MUCH faster
every year, not just "twice as fast" like in normal PC's. So every year,
D-wave's quantum computer will be getting orders of magnitude faster - at
least for that particular task.

Unless it runs on "normal" technology. ;)

After all - if they used simple PCs and LM bought one of their products, then
everything already paid off. It would be sort of hilarious, but not so
unexpected.

The future is here. Yet we might as well be living in the past. It could very
well be 1982 outside - everything of today is already outdated in our minds..

Eh, quantum computing… I still put my money on it being bullshit, on behalf
how it is supposed to magically resolve lot of our NP-hard problems.

Btw, does people in this paper even try to measure scaling of theirs new
wonder tool? If its really quantum, then it should scale differently with size
of the problem. Brutal force salesman problem has an exponential scaling,
scaling of D-Wave solution should be lower. If it isnt, then well… ;)

PS. To those, who thing LM buying this thing means it must be true - nope. LM
has a ton of cash and dont give a f**k for few million bucks. Their bought it,
because it _MIGHT_ be true. Now their are disassembling it to see if it works.
If it does, D-Wave guys are going to be like billions of dollars rich (since
their baby can break encryption pretty much everyone will try to buy it) or
dead. If it doesnt, no-one will say a word.

For that computer scaling of NP problems is +1 (nearly, there are some
limitations on qbits number), since it performs calculations on all states
simultaneously. Standard computers do tasks by recurence, adding one state to
a task exponentially enlarges the area of calculations.

It's slow now, but thanks to the nature of quantum mechanics, it's speed
increases exponentially and in a few years, it could be faster than all the
computers in the universe combined…

…assuming everything is kosher!

I wonder how well quantum computing works for grammar checking?

Misleading title. The article says that the new chip is 10,000 times faster on
the problems it was designed to solve.

Yeah but can it run windows 8

No

This is only the beginning of quantum technology. More will follow for sure.
Let's speak again about this in 15 years :)
