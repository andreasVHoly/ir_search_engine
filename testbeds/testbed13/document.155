# Google announces success with experimental quantum computer that is 100
million times faster than a PC

By taking advantage of the strange laws of quantum physics, Google claims its
new computer can solve problems millions of times faster than normal computers

Google's breakthrough could be the next step in supercomputer technology

After a number of failures at cracking quantum computing, Google has finally
announced that its D-Wave X2 supercomputer has seen success, in a test that
revaled it was 100 million times faster than a traditional desktop computer.

Google's artificial intelligence lab announced in 2013 that they would be
collaborating on a quantum computer with Nasa in 2013.

## 'Game-changing' breakthrough brings quantum computers a step closer

Previous tests have failed to show a performance advantage over regular
computers, but in an experiment in which the computer was given a "carefully
crafted proof-of-concept problem", in the words of Google engineering director
Hartmut Neven, the computer achieved a 100-million-fold speed-up compared to
the time it would take a typical computer to answer the problem.

This successful test has shown that the computer can answer certain algorithms
in seconds, rather than years.

Quantum computers work by taking advantage of the bizarre and incredibly
complex qualities of quantum physics.

Regular computers encode data into bits through the use of transistors, which
can only be in one of two definite states, 0 or 1.

Transistors are microscopically tiny, and by packing millions of them together
in chips, complex calculations can be made, running the computer programs we
use every day.

Thanks to advances in technology, these transistors are becoming smaller and
smaller. But as they reduce to an atomic scale, a theoretical limit on size
approaches, and the on-off function of transistors begins to by compromised by
the unusual laws of quantum mechanics - potentially creating a roadblock for
computer technology.

Quantum computers use quantum bits (qubits) rather than bits. On the tiny
quantum scale, these qubits can exist in a 'superposition' of either 0 or 1
simultaneously.

Using complex techniques to manipulate qubits, scientists can take advantage
of these superpositions and essentially conduct a number of different
calculations at once, using the same particles.

It's complicated and hard to follow, which explains why it hasn't been
achieved until now. Google has never been able to prove that their computer
has actually tapped into the quantum realm to conduct its calculations, but
now they have.

However, there is a catch - the breakthrough was made using one particular
problem that was designed to be easy for the D-Wave to solve.

Neven admitted in a blogpost announcing the breakthrough that some non-quantum
algorithms could beat the D-Wave in speed, but added "those methods will soon
become ineffective" as quantum hardware improves.

Quantum computing is a long way off from becoming easy, but as Nasa
exploration director Rupak Biswas said, "It is a truly disruptive technology
that could change how we do everything."
