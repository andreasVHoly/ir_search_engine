# Will quantum computers be good or bad for society?

I saw a documentary about hacking saying that quantum computers will be able
to crack RSA and encryption and all that. Will that be bad for activists and
whistleblowers around the world fighting the good fight? I'm assuming that
only governments and corporations will be able to afford these computers and
they will inevitably use them for their own agendas and if we look around the
world it doesn't paint a very pretty picture. In Australia we just passed meta
data retention laws (in my opinion to expose whistleblowers), in America they
demonise Edward Snowden, in India they are trying to get rid of NGOs, God
knows what China will do with it etc... And that's not even mentioning all the
despots and authoritarian regimes out there. What are your thoughts?

It is true that a scalable quantum computer would spell the end of RSA and
other public key cryptosystems. I'd agree that this would be an unequivocally
bad outcome for society.  
  
But there is a saving grace to quantum computing and it is called quantum
cryptography (or quantum key distribution). Quantum cryptography is unlike any
other form of public-key encryption out there in that is **provably secure**.
If you and I share a reliable quantum channel of communication, we can have a
fully encrypted conversation and get this: if someone tries to eavesdrop, the
system will be able to detect intrusion and report so to us.  
  
Moreover, quantum cryptography is far closer to widespread availability than
quantum computers are. I interned at NIST in Maryland (USA) in 2006 and even
back then, we had a quantum key distribution system spanning from the computer
in the foreground to the roof of the building in the background:  

There are already companies like ID Quantique and MagiQ which sell commercial
quantum cryptosystems to privacy-sensitive entities like banks.  
  
So I don't think quantum computers will be bad for society from the citizen
privacy standpoint. In fact, quantum cryptography will far outclass our
current encryption schemes to the point where the balance will tip far the
other way, as governments will no longer be able to eavesdrop on suspected
criminals in emergency situations.  
  
However, quantum computers would have widespread implications apart from
privacy that are worth considering as well. In particular, quantum computers
achieve a square-root speedup over traditional computers for many very hard
tasks (well, every NP-complete problem*) and an exponential speedup for
certain scientific problems involving simulation of quantum states. This is a
_fundamentally_ different and more powerful kind of speedup than the kind that
you can get by just cranking up the clock speed on a processor or by
increasing memory.  
  
How will this impact society? Well, I'm a techno-optimist, so the first things
that come to mind are that humanitarian problems like protein folding, flight
routing, spam detection, drug discovery, and language translation will become
easier.  
  
But Neo-Luddites will point to the more nefarious consequences that could
arise. A quantum computer in the hand of a rogue nation could be used to wreak
havoc. Elon Musk might tremble in fear at Google's Quantum Artificial
Intelligence Lab https://plus.google.com/+Quantum... (suggested reading:
http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.3097v1...).  
  
These concerns certainly have merit. But like I said, I am an optimist.
Ultimately, I think technological progress in computation will almost always
be good for society, and so, if quantum computers ever make it out of the
laboratory, I think we should welcome their advent.

* to be clear, this does not mean that quantum computers can solve NP-complete problems in polynomial time. The square root of an exponential is still an exponential, just with a smaller base.

Congress would probably go into lockdown and implement the same procedures it

DC police, assisted by the military if necessary, dispersed the crowd.  
  
An actual attack on Congress isn't just a riot. It's an effort to prevent the

Indeed, MIT specifically does Not allow a triple major, and instead of
awarding two bachelors degrees will award one bachelors degree that states it
is a Dual degree (e.g. Mechanical Engineering and Management).

If you are that interested in academics, then it is likely you will go on to
graduate school and become better at Your niche.    So instead of triple
