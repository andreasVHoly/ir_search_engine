# New Machine Bridges Classical and Quantum Computing

So-called boson-sampling computers could serve as a stopgap until the
development of more capable quantum computers

A new type of machine could rival quantum computers in exceeding the power of
classical computers, researchers say.

Quantum computers rely on the bizarre properties of atoms and the other
construction blocks of the universe. The world is a fuzzy place at its very
smallest levels -- in this realm where quantum physics dominates, things can
seemingly exist in two places at once or spin in opposite directions at the
same time.

The new computers rely on "boson" particles, and resemble quantum computers,
which differ from traditional computers in important ways. Normal computers
represent data as ones and zeroes, binary digits known as bits that are
expressed by flicking switch-like transistors on or off. Quantum computers,
however, use quantum bits, or qubits (pronouced "cue-bits"), that can be on
and off at the same time, a state known as "superposition."

This allows the machines to carry out two calculations simultaneously. Quantum
physics permits such behavior because it allows for particles that can exist
in two places at once or spin in opposite directions at the same time.

In principle, quantum computers could solve certain problems much faster than
can classical computers, because the quantum machines could run through every
possible combination at once. A quantum computer with 300 qubits could run
more calculations in an instant than there are atoms in the universe.

However, keeping qubits in superposition is challenging, and the problem grows
more difficult as more qubits are involved. As such, building quantum
computers that are more powerful than classical computers has proven very
difficult.

Now, though, two independent teams of scientists have built a novel kind of
device known as a boson-sampling computer. Described as a bridge between
classical and quantum computers, these machines also make use of the bizarre
nature of quantum physics. Although boson-sampling computers theoretically
offer less power than quantum computers are capable of producing, the machines
should still, in principle, out-perform classical computers in certain
problems.

In addition, a boson-sampling computer does not require qubits. As such, "it's
technologically far simpler to create than building a full-scale quantum
computer," said researcher Matthew Broome, a quantum physicist at the
University of Queensland in Australia.

Boson-sampling computers are actually a specialized kind of quantum computer
(which is known more formally as a universal quantum computer).

"The main difference between boson-sampling computers and universal quantum
computers is that boson-sampling quantum computers can't solve a universal set
of problems like universal quantum computers can," Broome said. "But they are
still conjectured to be able to solve problems that would be massively
intractable for classical computers. Boson sampling computers are an
intermediate model of a quantum computer."

Boson-sampling computers are not based on qubits, but on particles called
bosons. "In our case, we use photons," said researcher Ian Walmsley, a quantum
physicist at the University of Oxford in England. Photons are the packets of
energy that make up light, and are one type of boson.

Broome and Walmsley were in separate groups that each devised a boson-sampling
computer, based off concepts first described by theoretical computer scientist
Scott Aaronson at MIT. The computers involve multiple devices that can each
generate single photons. The photons are inserted into a network where they
can interact with one another. They emerge from outputs equipped with sensors
to analyze the particles.

The task of calculating which outputs these photons will emerge from, an
operation known as boson sampling, grows well beyond the capabilities of
classical computers the more photons are involved. The new computers
accurately resolved what paths the photons would take -- three photons with
Broome and his colleagues' machine and four in Walmsley and his collaborators'
device.

Since boson-sampling computing is in its infancy, it remains uncertain whether
these computers can solve problems beyond boson sampling. Still, this research
suggests that computers based on quantum physics could indeed tackle problems
beyond the reach of classical computers.

Previously, there was nothing to say "that anything you can do on a quantum
computer you can't do on a normal computer, which leaves in question the
necessity for quantum computers," Broome said. "Now, with boson sampling,
we're coming up with machines based on quantum physics that can attack
problems strongly believed to be intractable for classical computers."

In the future, "it would be great to push these computers toward more photons
to tackle problems that would be challenging to simulate on normal computers,"
study coauthor Walmsley added. Using about 20 to 30 photons would be a problem
beyond the capabilities of classical computers.

Both research teams detailed their findings online Dec. 20 in the journal
Science.
