#### Quantum Processors

Dreams of quantum computers has been around for decades. In the 1980s, Richard
Feynman showed that a classical Turing machine will encounter an exponential
slowdown in processing power, both in speed and memory, if it is used for
simulating quantum phenomena. What about a quantum calculating machine? The
idea of a quantum computer was born. Within a few years, researchers had shown
that a working quantum computer could perform certain tasks, such as data base
search (by Grover's algorithm) and factorization (with Shor's algorithm), much
faster than would be possible on a classical machine.

Research on how to actually build and operate a quantum computer continues.
Implementing quantum algorithms on physical platforms is a non-trivial task.
Atoms, photons, ions, electrons and numerous other microscopic systems have
all been proposed as quantum bits (qubits). Complicated control mechanisms
involving lasers and magnetic fields to implement the basic quantum gates have
been considered. However, a scalable quantum architecture that can maintain
the entanglement between qubits needed for computation is yet to be proven.

Quantum processor research in CQT spans quantum optical and condensed matter
systems and hybrids of these. For example, we work on how to efficiently
implement quantum algorithms like Grover's, how to create long-lived
entanglement in realistic dissipation conditions and how to simulate complex
quantum phenomena in simple optical set ups (in the group page of Dimitris G.
Angelakis). Kwek Leong Chuan's group is examining the possibilities of
performing quantum computing tasks without having to get physical qubits
interacting. Instead the qubits are kept at well separated sites and simply
subjected to measurement. This paradigm of distributed QIP is increasingly
perceived as an excellent prospect for a real, practical technology.
