#  It Works! Google's Quantum Computer is '100 Million Times Faster' than a PC

Announcing the results of its experiment, Google says Quantum Computer is More
than 100 Million times faster than a regular PC.

  

Two years ago, **Google **and **NASA **(_National Aeronautics and Space
Administration_) bought a **D-Wave 2X quantum computer**, which they have been
experimenting at the U.S. space agency's Ames Research Center in Mountain
View, California for the past two years.

  

The goal is to create a better way to solve highly complex problems in seconds
rather than years.

Now, a Google's Quantum AI team appears to have announced the results of its
latest test on D-Wave 2X quantum computer, demonstrating that quantum
annealing can outperform simulated annealing by over 108 times - that is
**100,000,000 times faster**.

  

###  What is **Quantum Computers?**

  

**Quantum computers** can theoretically be so much faster because they take advantage of quantum mechanics. While traditional computers use the "bits" to represent information as a 0 or a 1, quantum computers use "**qubits**" to represent information as a 0, 1, or both at the same time.

  

In turn, this allows Quantum computers to achieve a correct answer much faster
and efficiently through parallel processing.

  

###  Google's D-Wave 2X Quantum Computer

Now, the Google Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab has announced that its
D-Wave machine is considerably much faster than simulated annealing - quantum
computation simulation on a classical computer chip.

> _"We found that for problem instances involving nearly 1000 binary
variables, quantum annealing significantly outperforms its classical
counterpart, simulated annealing. It is more than 108 times faster than
simulated annealing running on a single core,"_ said **Hartmut Neven**,
Google's director of engineering.

###  Google: Our **Quantum Machine is 100 Million Times Faster**

Google has also published a paper [PDF] on the findings, claiming that the
team was able to perform a calculation with the quantum computing technology
that was significantly faster than a conventional computer with a single core
processor.

The researchers emphasized that their research on quantum computing is still
in the early stages and has yet to be commercialized which could take decades.

> _"While these results are intriguing and very encouraging, there is more
work ahead to turn quantum enhanced optimization into a practical technology,"
_Neven wrote.

However, the team of Google and NASA researchers announced on Tuesday that the
tests on D-Wave machines using Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm simulates running
an optimization problem on ordinary silicon, and again the results were **more
than 100 Million times faster** than a conventional computer.
