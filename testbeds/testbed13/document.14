# Quantum computer buyers' guide: Buy one today

By Michael Brooks

Can't wait to get your hands on a shiny new quantum computer? The good news is
that you can buy one today, if you have &amp;dollar;15 million to spare. The
bad news is nobody knows if it actually is one.

You can buy a quantum computer today – if you have &amp;dollar;15 million
spare

D-Wave Systems of Burnaby, Canada, is the upstart breaking in on the quantum
action. Its flagship model, known as D-Wave Two, or Vesuvius, contains 512
superconducting loops of niobium metal, each containing a Josephson junction.

But be warned, this is no quantum laptop. The whizzy-looking black box it's
housed in, along with its supporting cryogenic system and supercomputer
interface, fills a room 10 metres squared. Perhaps surprisingly then it runs
on just 15 kilowatts, less than a thousandth of the power devoured by
Tianhe-2, the world's fastest supercomputer.

A full 512-qubit performance would leave rivals in the dust, but D-Wave
doesn't worry about being able to address each qubit individually, with having
all the qubits entangled together or even operating properly as Josephson
junctions. So it's not clear that they actually are qubits, and tests have
proved inconclusive as to whether it really outperforms ordinary computers.

"We're not in the business of trying to prove whether it's quantum or not,"
says Bo Ewald, CEO of D-Wave USA. "We don't know how much coherence we've got,
but we've shown that eight qubits were entangled and some external work showed
40 were entangled." He believes all the loops are entangled, but doesn't want
to spend megabucks proving it&amp;colon; "Trying to measure this means turning
it into an experimental physics device. We're more focused on just using it as
a computer."

It's a computer with only one application&amp;colon; an optimisation algorithm
that searches for the best solution to a given problem. That's enough for
D-Wave's first two customers. Google is using it in machine learning for its
head-mounted display Google Glass; so far it has put the D-Wave machine to
work finding quicker ways to recognise certain objects in an image. Those can
be transplanted back into traditional computers, making them more efficient at
the task.

Lockheed Martin is using the machine to find out where its aircraft software
might go wrong. The company gives its aircraft control system a bad result –
such as the aircraft nose going in the wrong direction when the pilot pulls up
on the stick – and asks the D-Wave machine to look for input scenarios that
might lead there.

D-Wave thinks it'll find more customers in medical imaging, financial planning
and delivery scheduling, but the company is open to offers. It might also be
worth noting that Google has now started investing in other quantum
technologies&amp;colon; in September the company announced a partnership with
UCSB to build an Xmon-based quantum computer.
