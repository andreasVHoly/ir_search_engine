IBMIBM quantum computer scientist Jerry Chow.

On Wednesday, IBM scientists will make a quantum computer available to the
public as a cloud service for the first time.

Though the cloud service is geared mostly toward scientists and students,
anyone interested in this strange new computer will be able to give it a try,
Jerry Chow, one of the scientists leading the project, tells Business Insider.

## A different kind of computer

A quantum computer is different from today's digital computer.

A digital computer thinks in two states: zero and one (or off and on). A
quantum computer uses "combinations of zeroes and ones" to creates multiple
states. It can be a zero, a one, both at the same time, something in between
them, or it can be a mysterious zero/one state that you can't really
determine, Chow says.

Jerry Chow/IBMIBM's core team of quantum computer scientists, from left, Jay
Gambetta, Matthias Steffen, and Chow.

These messy states are called "entanglement," and there are some well-known
algorithms, or mathematical formulas, that use them, Chow tells us.

Because quantum computers think differently, they can quickly solve tasks that
regular computers can't do, such as working with billions of variables at the
same time, like the interaction between molecules in chemistry.

They are also great for machine-learning tasks. These computers are expected
to help find new drugs, new forms of computer security, and become smart
computers that can think and reason.

Likewise, programming a quantum computer is different.

So the IBM team has created a tutorial to help people learn how to do it. You
need high-school algebra skills and a background in programming. (It also
helps to read a book on the subject before trying your first "Hello world"
app, Chow advises.)

## As cold as outer space

Quantum computers are also built differently. This one uses a silicon base,
like regular computers, but relies on superconducting metals like niobium and
aluminum that must be kept unbelievably cold. The low temperature brings out
their special quantum mechanical properties.

IBMThis is the microwave hardware that generates pulses sent to the quantum
processor.

So it's kept in a special fridge that keeps the computer at ".015 above
absolute zero, which is colder than absolute space," Chow says. (See picture,
below.)

The computer behind this cloud service is a 5 quantum bits, or qubits,
computer, which is powerful (other quantum computers have been 2 qubits) but
not so much smarter than a regular supercomputer.

The industry, however, is working its way up to a 50 qubits computer, which
would be vastly more powerful than any of today's supercomputers.

No one knows what kinds of problems a computer that fast and smart could
solve.

But there's a race between IBM and Google to find out.

## The race with Google is on

IBM's work is based on research done at Yale through professor Robert
Schoelkopf (the IBM team is mostly his Ph.D. and post-grad students).

The other prominent US school working on this is the University of California
at Santa Barbara under professor John Martinis in an effort that was backed
and absorbed by Google in 2014.

"Google is working toward very similar goals," Chow says, describing the
situation as a bit of a turf war.

So score one for IBM for releasing the first cloud service.

Here are some photos of the computer.
