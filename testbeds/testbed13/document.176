Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has taken a leaf out of his Canadian
counterpart's book by explaining quantum computing to a Sydney university full
of top scientists.

Opening a new quantum computing lab complex at the University of New South
Wales (UNSW), Mr Turnbull warmed up the 100-strong crowd of academics with a
rundown on digital processing.

Last week Canadian PM Justin Trudeau stunned a room full of reporters and
physicists by explaining quantum computing to them after a joke question from
a journalist.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull

'Conventional computing, which as you know we call digital processing, which
depends on transistors with a series of on and off switches, ones and zeros,
if you like, that's the digital world,' Mr Turnbull said at UNSW on Friday
morning.

'(It's) extraordinarily fast, but we are reaching a finite limit.'

Mr Turnbull then unleashed on the power of quantum computing, saying UNSW was
positioned firmly at the fore.

'Quantum computing has the ability to revolutionise this (computing),' he
said.

'(Using) a silicon environment to render the phosphorous atom which is the
qubit, which is the particle being manipulated in a way that can operate in
more than one state at once.

'This super-positioning of the qubit enables vastly more rapid processing than
we've had before. But of course, this is a very dynamic environment, it isn't
a series of on-off switches.

Mr Turnbull is pictured here with Senator Bridget McKenzie, at the official
opening of the Quantum Computation and Communication Technology lab at the
University of New South Wales

'How do you render it stable, how do you control it, how do you stimulate it
to do what you want, and how do you ensure that it remembers what it's done
for a long enough period to be practically useful?'

Mr Turnbull said UNSW was leading the global pack in the research area.

'We looked at the memory time earlier that's been achieved here, a million
times more than has been achieved in other labs around the world,' he said.

'The use of silicon so stable to provide that environment, plus the super-cold
environment, enables a quantum computer to be built here that will become more
than a theory, will be become a reality, a truly supercomputer.

'The quantum computer, a processing power hitherto unimaginable, and certainly
not realised.'

He said the university, in Sydney's east, was up to 10 years ahead of any
other in the world.

Last week Canadian PM Justin Trudeau stunned a room full of reporters and
physicists by explaining quantum computing to them after a joke question from
a journalist

'There has never been a more exciting time to be in quantum computing than
right here,' Mr Turnbull quipped, to raucous laughter.

The new labs house six ultrahigh-tech 'scanning and tunnelling' microscopes,
which are used to manipulate individual atoms, along with cryogenic dilution
fridges capable of reaching temperatures close to absolute zero.

The facilities will double UNSW's capacity in the field, as it fends off
global competitors in the race to build the first quantum computer in silicon.

The prime minister said the cutting-edge technology fed into his government's
declaration of war on cyber crimes, which he announced on Thursday.

'Quantum computing has the ability to create the most unbreakable codes (and)
decipher the codes of today because it has that extraordinary processing
power,' he said.
