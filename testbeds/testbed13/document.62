# Shor's algorithm is implemented using five trapped ions

Mar 4, 2016 2 comments

  
Quantum factor: the Paul trap used by Monz and colleagues

A quantum computer made of five trapped ions has been used by physicists in
Austria and the US to implement Shor's factoring algorithm. While the system
performed the trivial task of factoring the number 15, the researchers say
that it could be scaled-up to factor much larger numbers. It is the first
implementation of Shor's algorithm in which prior knowledge of the factors was
not used to simplify the computational procedure.

Finding the integer factors of a large odd number is a very time-consuming
problem. While some numbers are easier to factor than others, there is no
known algorithm that can factor all numbers efficiently. As a result, large
numbers and their factors are used in some cryptography systems - and this
makes such systems vulnerable to anyone who can come up with an efficient
factoring algorithm.

### Periodic problem

In 1994, Peter Shor realized that a quantum computer could be much more
efficient at factoring large numbers than a conventional computer. Shor's
factoring algorithm begins by using mathematics to transform the problem of
factoring a large number into the problem of finding the period of a function
that describes a sequence of numbers. Then a quantum computer calculates the
period using a quantum Fourier transform. Mathematics is then used to convert
this period into the two factors.

In Shor's original scheme, a quantum computer with 12 quantum bits (qubits) is
needed to factor the number 15. While this might not seem like many, creating
a functioning quantum computer with this many qubits is beyond the current
capability of physicists. However, in 1995, Alexei Kitaev pointed out that the
algorithm can be run with fewer qubits (five qubits when factoring 15) if the
answer is output one qubit at a time.

This latest work was done by  Thomas Monz and colleagues at the University of
Innsbruck, and Isaac Chuang and team at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Using five trapped calcium-40 ions as qubits, the collaboration
used Kitaev's version of Shor's algorithm to factor the number 15.

### Laser addressing

Their quantum computer comprises a linear Paul trap in which an electric field
holds the five ions in a row. The ions are separated by 5 μm, and each ion can
be in one of two spin states, which correspond to qubit values of "0" and "1".
Each ion can be addressed individually using a laser with a spot width of just
1 μm.

The quantum calculation begins by loading the periodic function into four
qubits of the quantum computer. Then the quantum Fourier transform is done by
firing sequences of laser pulses at individual ions. Four qubits are used to
perform the quantum calculation, while the fifth is used to transfer
information within the computer and also to output the result one qubit at a
time.

Although the output of a single calculation was not perfect, it did allow the
user to deduce the factors of the number. However, if a calculation is
repeated eight times, the uncertainty in the result drops to below 1%.

### Scalable computer

Monz told _physicsworld.com_ that all of the processes used in their
implementation of Shor's algorithm can be scaled-up to factor larger numbers.
However, this would require a scalable quantum computer. "Our current linear
Paul trap would need to be replaced with a segmented trap," he explains. "We
have those in the lab already, but they are (despite being scalable) harder to
control and at an earlier stage of development than our linear Paul trap."

Indeed, Monz says that the team is now focussing on improving the fidelity of
its quantum computer by using better lasers, reducing background noise and
gaining better control over magnetic fields.

Barry Sanders of the University of Calgary in Canada believes that the
importance of this work by Monz and colleagues is that they did not exploit
prior knowledge of the factors of 15 in designing their computational
procedure. "Previous experiments used such knowledge and thereby
oversimplified the circuit," he explains.

The calculations are described in _Science_.
