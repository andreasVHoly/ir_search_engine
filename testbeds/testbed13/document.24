# Cluster-state quantum computation

by Michael Nielsen on April 15, 2005

One of my main areas of research interest for the past few years has been
_measurement-based_ models of quantum computation. In the standard accounts of
quantum computing, a quantum computer is presented as a device that gets its
power by performing coherent manipulations of superpositions of computational
states, before a final measurement step destroys the superposition, singling
out a single computational state to be read out.

Measurement-based quantum computing turns this picture on its head. In such a
model, there are no coherent manipulations of superpositions. Instead, it's
just all measurements, all the time. In Debbie Leung's memorable phrase, we
compute by "pinging Nature".

I've just written a short pedagogical review of one of these models, the so-
called "one-way quantum computer", or "cluster-state model" of quantum
computation. A simple version of this model was recently implemented in the
lab, as reported in _Nature_ by the Zeilinger group.

The review is written to be accessible to anyone with a thorough grounding in
basic quantum mechanics. The main part of the review is spent explaining what
a quantum computer is, what the cluster state model is, and how clusters can
be used to simulate an ordinary quantum computer. At the end, I also explain
two new results: (1) a no-go theorem which, subject to some caveats (see
paper), forbids us from obtaining the cluster experimentally by cooling a
physical system to the ground state; and (2) a proof that clusters must be
prepared in two or more dimensions if they are to be useful for quantum
computing.

The review was written for a festschrift in honour of Tony Bracken and Angas
Hurst, two well-known Australian mathematical physicists. Tony was my fourth-
year honours thesis advisor, for which he suggested a wonderful topic: whether
there is any connection between sometimes-negative "probability" distribution
functions, like the Wigner function, and the Bell inequalities. It was a great
topic for a student, combining a fundamental physical aspect with beautiful
mathematics, and requiring only a little background to get started.

More in the Moorcock vein. It's easy to imagine the reaction of the critic,
holding their nose at writing to formula. But you can turn that around,
regarding Dent (and, more plausibly, Moorcock) as a student and theoretician
of structure. And that's a pretty powerful point of view. Of course, word-by-
word Dent is a poor […]
