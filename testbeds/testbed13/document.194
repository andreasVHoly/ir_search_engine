## IBM Inches Ahead of Google in Race for Quantum Computing Power

IBM believes it can demonstrate an experimental chip that will prove the power
of quantum computers in just a few years.

All kinds of things are hooked up to the Internet these days, but Jerry Chow’s
computer stands out. Chilled by liquid helium, his superconducting processor
uses quantum physics to circumvent rules of everyday reality that limit the
power of conventional computers.

Chow manages IBM’s quantum computing group at the company’s Thomas J. Watson
research center in Yorktown Heights, New York. The team launched a website
today with an interface that lets outside programmers and researchers test
algorithms on the new chip.

Chow says he wants to get them ready for the undetermined point in the future
when this exotic kind of cloud computer is ready for practical use. “We want
to help people think differently and learn how to program a quantum computer,”
says Chow.

IBM, Google, Microsoft, and many academic groups are all trying to develop
quantum computers because they should be able to solve problems that are
practically impossible for conventional computers. Not many research groups
can build chips like IBM’s, and they are not usually made available to others
beyond select collaborators, says David Corey, a researcher at the Institute
for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo, Canada. And making a chip
reliable enough to be available 24/7 online is impressive, he says. “I don’t
know any system that shows this robustness.”

IBM’s chip has five devices called qubits that can represent digital data
using quantum physics.

Chow’s group also published details of a second new quantum chip today. They
claim it gets closer than any before to demonstrating all the error-correction
features required to make a universal quantum computer, the type of quantum
computer best understood by theorists. But no such machine exists because
physicists haven’t figured out how to fully tame the flakiness that comes
along with the potential power of representing data using delicate quantum
states.

IBM’s paper is not peer reviewed, but its latest chip would put the company
just ahead of Google in the race for a universal quantum computer. The search
and ads giant established a new lab to build quantum chips last year (see
“Google’s Quantum Dream Machine”).

Still, neither company expects to build a universal quantum computer very
soon.

Quantum computing chips are made up of devices called qubits that represent
digital data using quantum effects. Their computational power comes from weird
tricks like entering a fragile mode called a superposition that can be thought
of as simultaneously 0 and 1. A practical universal quantum computer would
require hundreds of thousands or millions of qubits because of the
considerable weight of error-correcting code needed. The chips IBM announced
today have five and seven qubits. The best chip Google’s lead researcher has
made has nine.

However, Chow’s team is also aiming at a more limited kind of quantum
processor that may offer a shortcut to computational riches.  A so-called
analog quantum computer could operate with less error-correcting code, and
hence require a much smaller number of qubits. It would only be able to take
on certain problems, but they would include chemistry simulations important to
energy and materials research, and machine learning, says Chow.

Scott Aaronson, an associate professor at MIT, says that’s a worthy goal. He
says a collection of just 50 qubits operated that way will likely be the first
computer to demonstrate “quantum supremacy”—the power to solve a computational
problem immensely difficult and perhaps practically impossible for
conventional machines. (Google last year reported a striking result using a
quantum processor of a different design from startup D-Wave, but it fell short
of quantum supremacy—see “Google Says Its Controversial Quantum Computer
Really Works.”)

“The first clear demonstration of quantum supremacy will be a huge milestone
in the history of physics and computer science,” says Aaronson. “It's
plausible, though not certain, that it could be achieved in the near future.”

Chow says his team has that in its sights. “We’re not that far from building
it,” he says. “We do believe that 50 qubits is possible in the next handful of
years.”

The IBMers have competition, though. Google’s quantum computing team is also
aiming to build analog quantum processors, and estimates it could have a chip
with 100 qubits ready in just a few years. Academic groups, for example at the
University of Maryland, are also trying to build analog quantum processors.

IBM’s Chow is unfazed, and predicts that competition will intensify as it
becomes clearer what analog quantum processors might be useful for. “There are
a number of companies making grabs for the IP now,” he says. “I think there
will be more work on this as this scenario becomes clearer.”
