       Description 
        This security setting determines if the Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer (TL/SS) Security Provider supports only the TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA cipher suite. In effect, this means that the provider only supports the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol as a client and as a server (if applicable). It uses only the Triple DES encryption algorithm for the TLS traffic encryption, only the Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman (RSA) public key algorithm for the TLS key exchange and authentication, and only the Secure Hashing Algorithm&nbsp;1 (SHA-1) for the TLS hashing requirements. 
        For Encrypting File System Service (EFS), it supports only the Triple Data Encryption Standard (DES) encryption algorithm for encrypting file data supported by the NTFS file system. By default, EFS uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm with a 256-bit key in the Windows Server&nbsp;2003 family and DESX algorithm in Windows&nbsp;XP for encrypting file data.
