Data Structure is a way to organized data in such a way that it can be used efficiently. This tutorial explains basic terms related to data structure.

Data Definition
Data Definition defines a particular data with following characteristics.
    Atomic − Definition should define a single concept
    Traceable − Definition should be be able to be mapped to some data element.
    Accurate − Definition should be unambiguous.
    Clear and Concise − Definition should be understandable.

Data Object
Data Object represents an object having a data.

Data Type
Data type is way to classify various types of data such as integer, string etc. which determines the values that can be used with the corresponding type of data, the type of operations that can be performed on the corresponding type of data. Data type of two types −

    Built-in Data Type
    Derived Data Type

Built-in Data Type
Those data types for which a language has built-in support are known as Built-in Data types. For example, most of the languages provides following built-in data types.
    Integers
    Boolean (true, false)
    Floating (Decimal numbers)
    Character and Strings

Derived Data Type

Those data types which are implementation independent as they can be implemented in one or other way are known as derived data types. These data types are normally built by combination of primary or built-in data types and associated operations on them. For example −
    List
    Array
    Stack
    Queue

Basic Operations
The data in the data structures are processed by certain operations. The particular data structure chosen largely depends on the frequency of the operation that needs to be performed on the data structure.
    Traversing
    Searching
    Insertion
    Deletion
    Sorting
    Merging
