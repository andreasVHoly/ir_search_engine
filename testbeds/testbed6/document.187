     Simple Data Types 
      Most programming languages support at least four simple data types: 
       Character: a single letter, digit, special character or control character 
       Integer: a whole number 
       Floating point: a number with a fractional part, sometimes referred to as a real number. 
       Boolean: a logical data type that can only take the values True or False. 
      In this course we’re going to use the Java programming language. Java calls simple data types Primitive Data Types. It supports a single character data type (char), three integer data types (byte, short, int and long), two floating point data types (float and double) and a single Boolean data type (boolean). We’ll look at each of these more closely in the following sections.
