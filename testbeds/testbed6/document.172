TREE TRAVERSAL

Tree traversal is a process of moving through a tree in a specified order to
process each of the nodes.   Each of the nodes is processed only once
(although it may be visited more than once).  Usually, the traversal process
is used to print out the tree. 

Traversal is like searching the tree except that in traversal the goal is to
move through the tree in some particular order.  In addition, all nodes are
processed in the traversal but searches cease when the required node is
found. 

If the order of traversal is not specified and the tree contains n nodes,
then the number of paths that could be taken through the n nodes would be n
factorial and therefore the information in the tree would be presented in
some format determined by the path.  Since there are many different paths,
no real uniformity would exist in the presentation of information. 

Therefore, three different orders are specified for tree traversals.  These
are called: 

  *  pre-order
  *  in-order
  *  post-order

The traversals considered here are for a binary tree or a binary search
tree.   

Because the definition of a binary tree is recursive and defined in terms of
the left and right subtrees and the root node, the choices for traversals
can also be defined from this definition.  In pre-order traversals, each
node is processed before (pre) either of its sub-trees. In in-order, each
node is processed after all the nodes in its left sub-tree but before any of
the nodes in its right subtree (they are done in order from left to right).
In post-order, each node is processed after (post) all nodes in both of its
sub-trees. 

Each order has different applications and yields different results.
