The scheme of organizing related information is known as ‘data structure’.

The types of data structure are:
Lists: A group of similar items with connectivity to the previous or/and next data items.
Arrays: A set of homogeneous values
Records: A set of fields, where each field consists of data belongs to one data type.
Trees: A data structure where the data is organized in a hierarchical structure. This type of data structure follows the sorted order of insertion, deletion and modification of data items.
