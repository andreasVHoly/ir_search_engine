Phaser is a fast, free and fun open source HTML5 game framework. It uses a custom build of [Pixi.js](https://github.com/GoodBoyDigital/pixi.js/) for WebGL and Canvas rendering across desktop and mobile web browsers. Games can be compiled to iOS, Android and desktop apps via 3rd party tools like Cocoon, Cordova and Electron.

Along with the fantastic open source community Phaser is actively developed and maintained by [Photon Storm Limited](http://www.photonstorm.com). As a result of rapid support and a developer friendly API Phaser is currently one of the [most starred](https://github.com/showcases/javascript-game-engines) game frameworks on GitHub.

Thousands of developers worldwide use it. From indies and multi-national digital agencies to schools and Universities. Each creating their own incredible games. Grab the source and join in the fun!

## What's new in Phaser 2.4.7

<div align="center"><img src="http://phaser.io/images/github/news.jpg"></div>

> 22nd April 2016

We're pleased to announce the release of Phaser 2.4.7. This version encompasses another raft of fixes, updates and new features. Many hours of hard work were put in to diligently working through the GitHub issues list, and fixing and closing down as many issues as we possibly could.

My thanks to all those who contributed to this release, either by way of telling us about an issue, providing a fix, or just testing out the release candidate.

There are a few internal changes in 2.4.7, nothing that breaks the public-facing API, but if you do some deep-dive work in Phasers guts then you may want to check out the change log, and commit history, to be sure it doesn't impact your own code.

We are now splitting our time between development of Lazer, and Phaser 2.5. We decided, after much discussion with the community, that we owed it to Phaser to go out on a high, so 2.5 will be the version in which we do just that. After this Phaser will enter the LTS (long-term support) stage of its life.

This is when we impose a feature freeze, locking the API down and responding only to bugs. This is a necessary step to allow us to focus on Lazer while still ensuring Phaser is given the support it deserves.

As always, keep you eyes on the Phaser web site, our weekly newsletter, or follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/photonstorm) for the latest updates.

We'd be extremely grateful if you could get involved with our [Phaser Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/photonstorm). The uptake so far has been fantastic. Thank you to everyone who now supports Phaser development and shares our belief in the future of HTML5 gaming, and Phasers role in that.

Happy coding everyone! See you on the forums.

Cheers,

Rich - [@photonstorm](https://twitter.com/photonstorm)
