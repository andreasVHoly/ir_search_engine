### Turn eTags Off
By removing the `ETag` header, you disable caches and browsers from being able to validate files, so they are forced to rely on your `Cache-Control` and `Expires` header. [Source](http://www.askapache.com/htaccess/apache-speed-etags.html)
``` apacheconf
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    Header unset ETag
</IfModule>
FileETag None
```

## Miscellaneous

### Set PHP Variables
``` apacheconf
php_value <key> <val>

# For example:
php_value upload_max_filesize 50M
php_value max_execution_time 240
```

### Custom Error Pages
``` apacheconf
ErrorDocument 500 "Houston, we have a problem."
ErrorDocument 401 http://error.example.com/mordor.html
ErrorDocument 404 /errors/halflife3.html
```

### Force Downloading
Sometimes you want to force the browser to download some content instead of displaying it.
``` apacheconf
<Files *.md>
    ForceType application/octet-stream
    Header set Content-Disposition attachment
</Files>
```

Now there is a yang to this yin:

### Prevent Downloading
Sometimes you want to force the browser to display some content instead of downloading it.
``` apacheconf
<FilesMatch "\.(tex|log|aux)$">
    Header set Content-Type text/plain
</FilesMatch>
```

### Allow Cross-Domain Fonts
CDN-served webfonts might not work in Firefox or IE due to [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing). This snippet solves the problem.
``` apacheconf
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    <FilesMatch "\.(eot|otf|ttc|ttf|woff|woff2)$">
        Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
    </FilesMatch>
</IfModule>
```

### Auto UTF-8 Encode
Your text content should always be UTF-8 encoded, no?
``` apacheconf
# Use UTF-8 encoding for anything served text/plain or text/html
AddDefaultCharset utf-8

# Force UTF-8 for a number of file formats
AddCharset utf-8 .atom .css .js .json .rss .vtt .xml
```

### Switch to Another PHP Version
If youâ€™re on a shared host, chances are there are more than one version of PHP installed, and sometimes you want a specific version for your website. The following snippet should switch the PHP version for you.

``` apacheconf
AddHandler application/x-httpd-php56 .php

# Alternatively, you can use AddType
AddType application/x-httpd-php56 .php
```

### Disable Internet Explorer Compatibility View
Compatibility View in IE may affect how some websites are displayed. The following snippet should force IE to use the Edge Rendering Engine and disable the Compatibility View.

``` apacheconf
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
    BrowserMatch MSIE is-msie
    Header set X-UA-Compatible IE=edge env=is-msie
</IfModule>
```

### Serve WebP Images
If [WebP images](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/?csw=1) are supported and an image with a .webp extension and the same name is found at the same place as the jpg/png image that is going to be served, then the WebP image is served instead.

``` apacheconf
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{HTTP_ACCEPT} image/webp
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/$1.webp -f
RewriteRule (.+)\.(jpe?g|png)$ $1.webp [T=image/webp,E=accept:1]
```
