**N1 is an open-source mail client built on the modern web with [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/).** It is designed to be extensible, so it's easy to create new experiences and workflows around email. N1 is built on the Nylas Sync Engine which is also [open source free software](https://github.com/nylas/sync-engine).

# Download N1

You can download compiled versions of N1 for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (.deb) from [https://nylas.com/N1](https://nylas.com/N1). You can also build and run N1 on Fedora. A Fedora distribution is coming soon!

# Build A Plugin

Plugins lie at the heart of N1 and give it its powerful features. Building your own plugins allows you to integrate the app with other tools, experiment with new workflows, and more. Follow the [Getting Started guide](http://nylas.com/N1/getting-started/) to write your first plugin in 5 minutes. To create your own theme, go to our [Theme Starter guide](http://github.com/nylas/N1-theme-starter).

If you would like to run the N1 source and contribute, check out our [contributing
guide](https://github.com/nylas/N1/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

# Plugin List
We're working on building a plugin index that makes it super easy to add them to N1. For now, check out the list below! (Feel free to submit a PR if you build a plugin and want it featured here.)
