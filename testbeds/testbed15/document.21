Animation and CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) in Cinema
What are the Pros and Cons of Computer Generated Imagery (CGI)?
For the Pros, Computer can make some roles play in the film and these roles are not existing in the real world although it is performed by some actors in the "backstage", for example, the apes in the Rise of the Planet of the Apes.
Indeed, it can help the author to have a great creativity in a film script. It is because author don't need to have misgiving about the authenticity and feasibility of the characters when he or she creates it. That means all the imagined can come true in the film. Most importantly, CGI make hyperrealism. We can enjoy it so much.
As for the Cons of it, as we all know, the movement, facial expression and gesture are all presented by the real actors behind the scenes. Actors don't need to show their face and appearance, so no audience would know who they are without casting information. It is not fair for them because actors also strive for the best performance. When the film is being famous, the actors may not obtain the same benefits.
Also, CGI may not be as real as the normal role because of the hyperrealism too. We never see the characters which are made by digital technology, we would not believe that these characters are existing in the world as it is not a real thing.
Will Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) makes actors obsolete? Yes or no? Why?
 I think that CGI will not make actors obsolete. The main reason for that is that CGI  is unlike real actors although it can make a dynamic or lively characters. For example, CGI often used to make some 3-dimensional graphics in the science fiction film. However, people would think it is an imagination or a fake graphical image because of hyperrealism. It is ironic that when people are weary of hyperrealism, they would like to choose the real actors again, not the CGI. 
So, I think CGI would not make actors obsolete and replace it. They can exist simultaneously.
Should digital characters be nominated for acting awards competing with humans?
 As I mentioned before, all the motions of CGI are presented and performed by real actors through digital technology. It really involves the acting section. So, I think digital characters should be nominated for acting awards in the above situation.
On the other hand, some digital characters are created by scanning clay model and used in an animation. These digital characters are not existing in the real world and so they are inanimate. Actually, digital characters can be infinite if people have an inspiration to create more and more. It can be said that it is an imagination for human. Actually, acting awards should be rewarded for someone who are good at acting and making a breakthrough as well as contribution for the film industry. Thus, I don't think this type of digital characters should be nominated for acting awards.
What are the advantages and disadvantages of motion capture?
One of the advantages of motion capture is that it can make the charcaters more dynamic and lively in their performance. It can give an enjoyment for the audience who love watching animation.  
In addition, motion capture can help to express the psychological states and personal feelings if characters have a natural and suitable motion.
However, motion capture may have a sense of exaggeration. When actors want to show one action, they would portray themselves deliberately. It may destroy the whole unity of motion capture, so that audience may think the motion capture is so strange.
Moreover, motion capture may draw the audience's attention and then audience may not concentrate on the content of the movie. There is a loss when paying attention on motion capture excessively.
Should animation strive for photorealism?
I don't think that animation should strive for photorealism.
It is because animation acn be a space for our imagination. To me, I regard animation as a form of recreation. It can help us release daily life pressure. Sometimes, photorealism may be too rigid and even static. If it strive for photorealism, we may lose one enjoyment or pastime.
