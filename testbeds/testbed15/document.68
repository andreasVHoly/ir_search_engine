. Introduction
One of the problems conventional computer animation has to deal with is the generation of motions that appear natural and realistic. On the other hand, it is important for the biomechanist creating, verifying or utilizing models, to visualize and present adequately the results of simulations based on these models. Computer animation is a powerful tool for presenting complex interdependencies clearly. User selectable frame rates and points of observation offer numerous possibilities in the form of presentation. If the animations are based on physical models, realistic motions are obtained. Thus, not only is computer animation a valuable tool for studying and comprehending the results of biomechanical simulations, but the use of (bio)mechanical models has also improved realism of computer animations.

An instructive form of presentation, which is particularly useful for comparing actual and simulated motions, results from overlaying video sequences with computer animations. This method is also applicable for presenting the results of model-based human motion analyses, such as calculated joint torques, compressive or shear forces, simultaneously with the motion of the subject.

Applications of three-dimensional and video overlaid animations have been developed and will be presented in the sequel. Before this is done, a short survey of the animation techniques used is given.

2. Three-dimensional computer animation
Three methods can be distinguished for generating three-dimensional computer animations[1]. The principle of the first method, image-based keyframe animation, is to create inbetween frames by interpolating keyframe images supplied by the animator. The second method, parametric keyframe animation, is based on describing the keyframes by a set of parameter values, which are interpolated. If the motion is algorithmically described by a list of transformations defined by parameters, which may change during the animation according to certain physical laws, the third method, algorithmic animation, can be applied. Such parameters may be time-dependent data sequences provided as a result of a biomechanical simulation. Examples of such parameters are rotation angles, e.g. the rotation angles describing the position of the right forearm in relation to the right upper arm in the case of human motion simulation.

If the animated motion needs to be viewed from different positions, three-dimensional graphical models have to be developed. In computer modeled animation[2], three main activities are involved. First, the three-dimensional objects, which are animated, have to be modeled. These models must be parameterized so that differences in the geometry can be taken into account. In the next step, the motion must be specified. In the last step, realistic images must be produced by removing hidden surfaces and adding effects like shading. This process is called “image rendering”. Three methods have been established for this purpose. The polygon shading method is often hardware implemented and can be performed in real time. The surfaces of the objects are constructed of primitive polygons such as triangles and quadrangles which may be shaded. The ray tracing and radiosity method allow the generation of realistic images but are expensive in computation time.

Animations can either be generated in real time or produced frame by frame. Real-time computer animation is limited by the capabilities of the computer, because at least 15 frames per second must be displayed to generate the illusion of a continuous movement. Frame by frame animation systems use the computer to produce each frame individually. Afterwards, the frames are presented in real time. This can be achieved by the real-time playback method, where computed frames are saved in mass storage and then displayed by a real-time program. Another possibility is to store the frames on a videorecorder and to display the whole sequence afterwards. Using the frame buffer animation method means dividing the pixel memory into different regions, where each region contains a frame, and displaying the images by using zoom, pan and scroll operations.

3. Video overlaid animation
The principle of this presentation technique is to splice together animation with digital video files. The video images are first captured from videotape or videocamera using frame-grabber boards, or provided by special digital recording systems, such as the KODAK EKTAPRO 1000 system used in the application to be described. The video images are then overlaid with the corresponding frames of the animation and either displayed by applying the real-time playback method or stored on a videorecorder frame by frame.

4. Animation of the ball–racket impact phase
Models of the tennis racket and the ball have been developed by Hatze[3], which permit the simulation of the ball–racket impact. The result of the simulation yields not only information on the time-dependent three-dimensional positions and orientations of racket and ball (three linear coordinates of the center of mass and three Cardan angles each) but, in addition, on the transverse and torsional vibrations of the racket as well as on the deflections of the string plane and the compression of the ball. Graphical models of the racket and the ball have been constructed. That of the racket is parameterized, so that the shape of the racket's head can be varied. The polygon shading method is used for image rendering, a frame by frame technique for creating the animation. The animation system has been implemented on a parallel computing system based on T800 transputers. Fig. 1 shows one frame of an animation sequence. Arrows represent the simulated impact force and reaction forces on the racket, which is held by an artificial arm in the model simulation.

5. Animated presentation of drop jump analysis results
Drop jumps are exercises for improving reactive capabilities (e.g.[4]). Athletes performing that kind of motion jump down from a raised platform and, upon landing, execute a maximal vertical jump. Different methods are applied to analyze drop jumps biomechanically. In particular, the vertical jumping height, i.e. the height, at which the mass center is raised from leaving the ground to the vertex of the flight phase, and the durations of the phases of downward and upward movements during foot contact with the ground are used for quantifying the jumping capability. These parameter values are determined from measured data. A rather inaccurate method estimates the jumping height from the flight time, i.e., from the time between the instant of leaving the ground and the instant of landing. This method works if and only if the height of the mass center at the instant of leaving the ground is exactly that at the instant of landing. In another method (e.g.[5]), markers are placed on the skin of the subject in order to define the positions of the bodysegments and the motion is recorded with a high-speed motion analysis system. In combination with a model of the human body, the trajectory of the mass center of the whole body is calculated. The jumping height is then computed as difference between the highest position reached by the mass center and the height of this mass center at the instant of leaving the ground. There are, however, sources which may introduce errors into these calculations: the position of the mass center is calculated from markers applied to the skin of the subjects. Due to skin motion, these markers shift relative to the skeleton. Moreover, the center of mass is calculated utilizing models, which do not comprise all relevant degrees of freedom of the real human body. For example, in most of these models, the whole torso is modeled as a rigid segment. Consequently, the trajectory of the mass center will be calculated erroneously and all parameter values derived from it as well. The correct jumping height and durations of the phases of downward and upward movements can, for example, be calculated, if the vertical ground reaction forces during take off from the raised platform and during the vertical jump are measured. The jumping height is then derived from the integral of the net vertical force (vertical ground reaction force minus body weight) taken from the instant of beginning the take-off motion to the instant of leaving the ground.

Two force plates have been integrated into our experimental setup to measure these ground reaction forces. The drop jumps are recorded with a frequency of 250 frames per second with a KODAK EKTAPRO 1000 high-speed video system, which allows recording frequencies of up to 1000 frames per second. The resolution of the recorded images is, however, only 239×192 pixels. The 17-segment model of Hatze[6], which is very detailed when compared to other anthropomorphic models, is used to calculate the trajectory of the mass center.

Video overlaid animations can now be generated to illustrate the differences resulting from applying the different methods. The video images of the motion are overlaid with graphical elements illustrating the following quantities: ground reaction forces (neglecting the component perpendicular to the sagittal plane); the vertical position of the center of mass relative to the position at the instant that the toes loose contact with the ground, and the vertical instantaneous velocity. The latter quantities are calculated applying the exact method using two force platforms (illustrated by bars labeled A in Fig. 2), the method based on the determination of the trajectory of the center of mass (B in Fig. 2) and the flight time method (C in Fig. 2). The base-line is set to the (approximate) vertical position of the center of mass at the instant that the toes loose contact with the ground. The overlaid images are stored frame by frame on a videorecorder. A miroVIDEO DC1 board is used for that purpose. The real-time playback method is also applicable. Fig. 2 shows one frame of an animation sequence.

6. Summary
The suitability of computer animation techniques for visualizing biomechanical research results has been demonstrated. Increased computer performance and improved graphic facilities have offered this economical and efficient method for communicating and presenting information.

The main aspects of three-dimensional and video overlaid animation have been summarized. Both techniques have been illustrated by practical applications.

As an example of computer modeled animation, which is probably the most important form of three-dimensional animation for presenting the results of biomechanical analyses or simulations of human or animal motions, the simulated ball–racket impact phase has been visualized. Three-dimensional parameterized geometric models of the tennis racket and the ball have been developed for this purpose. The motion of racket and ball (translation, rotation, transverse and torsional vibrations of the racket, deflection of the string plane and compression of the ball) is given as result of a biomechanical simulation. A polygon shading method is used for image rendering and for removing hidden surfaces respectively.

As an example of video overlaid animation, high-speed video sequences of recorded drop jumps, i.e. motions, where athletes jump down from a raised platform and, upon landing, execute a maximum vertical jump, have been overlaid with graphical elements to compare three methods for determining the jumping height and related parameters. The vertical position of the center of mass relative to the position that the toes loose contact with the ground and the vertical instantaneous velocity are represented by bars of variable length. Both quantities have been calculated applying the three different methods, so that differences can vividly be demonstrated.
