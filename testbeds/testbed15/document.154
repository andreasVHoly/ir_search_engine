We live in a 3D world. People move, think and experience in three dimensions.

Much of our media is also 3D— though it is usually presented on flat screens. Animated films are created from computer-generated 3D images. Online map services allow us to explore our destination, virtually, in a 3D environment. Most video games, whether running on dedicated consoles or mobile phones, are rendered in 3D. Even the news has gone 3D: the sight of a CNN analyst meandering through a virtual set, comically awkward a few years ago, has become an accepted part of the broadcast vocabulary as cable channels vie for increasing attention in a twenty-four hour news cycle.

3D graphics is nearly as old as the computer itself, tracing its roots back to the 1960’s. It has been used in applications spanning engineering, education, training, architecture, finance, sales and marketing, gaming and entertainment. Historically, 3D applications have relied on high-end computer systems and expensive software. But that has changed in the last decade. 3D processing hardware is now shipped in every computer and mobile device, with the consumer smart phone of today possessing more graphics power than the professional workstation of fifteen years before. More importantly, the software required to render 3D is now not only universally accessible; it’s free. It’s called a web browser.

Figure 1-1 shows an excerpt from 100,000 Stars, a browser-based 3D flythrough simulation of our stellar neighbors in the Milky Way. Using the mouse, you can rotate about the galactic plane and zoom in to a star of interest. Stars are represented with renderings that approximate their apparent magnitude and color. Each star is labeled with its common name; when you mouse over the label, it highlights. Click on the label, and an overlay appears displaying the Wikipedia entry for that star. Click on a hyperlink in the overlay text, and the browser will launch that link in a new tab. 100,000 Stars is a stunningly produced interactive experience featuring beautiful renderings, pulsing animations, a majestic soundtrack, and an artfully integrated 2D user interface.
