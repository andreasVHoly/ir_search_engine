Top North American Cities for animation careers
Animation is an exciting, dynamic and growing field—and good thing, because there are plenty of aspiring animators anxiously waiting in the wings to become the next Chuck Jones. But where exactly are all these animators going to be absorbed into the industry?   Well, animation jobs tend to gravitate towards artistically focused epicenter cities that cater to entertainment sectors—like film and gaming—so living and learning in Bummsville, USA (population: 37) likely won't cut it if you want to be a successful animator.
So where should you live if you want a successful career in animation AND an overall happy life? Well, a number of cities offer exciting career prospects and inspirational atmospheres:

1. San Francisco Bay Area, California
It’s no secret that San Francisco is an artistic hub in the US. It is home to some of the most enduring performing-arts companies in the country, like the San Francisco Opera (the second-largest opera company in the US), the San Francisco Symphony and the San Francisco Ballet. This artsy city is also home to groovy art venues like Beach Blanket Babylon and the Orpheum Theatre, both of which draw a certain type of refined artistic crowd.

But SF isn't just an artsy town, it's also the home of the country's technological innovation sector...Silicon Valley. When San Francisco experienced the tech explosion in Silicon Valley some of its artists saw an opportunity to combine the city's two passions: art and technology, and jumped into animation head first. Shortly after, others jumped on the bandwagon and San Fran became a major hub for some of the country's most artistically talented animators. Some of the world's biggest animation firms, including Lucasfilm and Industrial Light & Magic, saw the burgeoning talent pool and made the city their home base.

What landed San Francisco such a primo spot on this list are its choices. You've got throngs of animation jobs all around the area, and tons of great little cities from which to choose to live. Across the bridge from SF, in Emeryville, you've got Pixar and EA. Down the road in Redwood you've got a DreamWorks and another branch of EA (the area's second largest employer, after Oracle), and there's there Capcom gaming in San Mateo. And the majors aren't the only one putting the area's talent base to work, in recent years a number of pop-up boutique studios have stabilized in the area, providing even more animation employment.

Not only are there jobs-a-plenty in San Francisco, it also has one of the highest levels of quality of life in the country—that is for those who can afford the post-gentrification prices. Real estate prices in San Francisco's core are high, but a great investment—which is why many people head for the hills since the cost of living in nearby suburbs and cities is significantly lower. Many animators choose to stick around San Francisco though, even if the gentrification and the high prices it causes do drive up the cost of living. The cost of living in one of the country's best cities is acceptable to many re-locating animators thanks to the area's cream-of-the-crop talent-seeking employers that have driven salaries sky high—big fish employers from the Dot-Com and Web 2.0 eras that made the city home of their HQs, including: Craigslist, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Zynga, Salesforce.com and the Wikimedia Foundation.  Due to the cost of living and competing local salaries, local animation studios pay a premium for top talent to relocate to the area, with salaries running from the low $90,000 to $110,000—the highest average in the country.

SF has become a popular home for the well-paid employees of major animation studios like Dolby Laboratories, Industrial Light & Magic, Lucasfilm and LucasArts. These career-driven animators have flocked to the city for its laid-back lifestyle, hippy-esque-yet-upwardly-mobile population, year-round warm weather, beautiful nature and never-ending inspiration. 

While studios in the area are always on the look out for the nation's hottest talent, not all talent has to be head-hunted from out of state; there is a large, local talent pool from which area studios can recruit. A pool created from the steady stream of graduates coming from the Academy of Art University (#33 on our list of the top 100 animation programs around the globe) in the heart of SF, Ex'pression College for Digital Arts (#67) in Emeryville, CalArts (#2 on our list) down in Valencia and the Gnomon Institute of Visual Effects (#21) in relatively-nearby Hollywood.

While many of you likely thought LA or NY would steal the number one spot, the quantity of jobs available, the high salaries and chilled-out artistic atmosphere (which is far more suited to wacky animators than Rodeo Drive) earned the bay our top spot. But LA wasn't far behind…
2. Los Angeles, California
LA defines the title World-Class City and is renowned as being the entertainment capital of...well, the planet. What can we say about LA that you don't already know? Dreams are made or broken here—just ask your waiter. And while restaurants are staffed with wannabe actors, animators coming to the city have a significantly better shot at the big time due to all the major players in the industry who call LA and the surrounding area home.

The list of production houses within the LA borders is by far the longest on this list, and includes Disney, MGM, the Motion Picture Corp of America, EA LA (their primary location), Sony Pictures Imageworks, Hasbro, DreamWorks, Acme Filmworks, Acorn Entertainment, Animax Entertainment, Bill Melendez Productions, Fred Wolf Films, Klasky Csupo, Renegade Animation, Rhythm & Hues, the Ebeling Group, Nickelodeon, Prana Studios, Ring of Fire, The Cartoon Network, Film Roman, Warner Bros, Sony Pictures Animation, FOX TV Animation, Bento Box Entertainment, Crest Animation, IM Digital (Image Movers), the ABC Family/Walt Disney, Abby Lou Entertainment, Blur Studio, Inc., Children's Media Productions, Chiodo Brothers Productions, Crest Animation Studios, DIC Entertainment, Digital Domain, Enoki Films, U.S.A, Film Roman, Inc., Foothill Entertainment, Inc., Gracie Films, The Jim Henson Company, Hyperion Studios, Kurtz & Friends, Liquid Light Studios, Live Wire Productions & VFX, Lee Mendelson Film Prodictions, Motion City Films, Multimedia Unsigned Records, Nelvana Communications, Inc., New Hollywood, Orbit Productions, Pacific Data Images (PDI), Pix N Stones Productions, Playground Media (VFX), PorchLight Entertainment, Puppet Studio, Pyros Pictures, Inc., Reality Check, Inc., Rhythm & Hues Studios, Ruby-Spears Productions, Six Foot Two Productions, Sony Pictures Animation, Sony Pictures Television, TLC Entertainment, Threshold Entertainment, TMS Entertainment, Toon Makers, Inc., 20th Century Fox Animation, Universal Cartoon Studios, Wild Brain, Inc., Fred Wolf Films, Mike Young Productions, Inc., and—surprisingly—many more.

The city of angels is a true mecca for animators, with thousands of aspiring animators drawn to the city each year and recruited into the world's top animation studios. And why wouldn't they be drawn here (drawn—get it? A little animation pun)? The quality of life in LA is quite good, although highly varied since the exact level is highly dependent on your chosen neighbourhood, socio-economic status and whom you hobnob with.

Every animator has their reason for residing in the City of Angels, some flock to the city primarily for its available animation jobs, other for the temperate warm weather and beautiful coastlines, while others come to rub elbows with celebs and powerful elite that practically own the city. Others come for the wine. And a select few, for Disney. 

Those lucky enough to score positions with the large animation firms in the area get to work with the top animators and producers in the industry and attend some of the world's best premiers and parties.

Now time for the only major downside of living in and around the animation metropolis: the traffic. Well, the brutal traffic AND sky-high prices. The traffic and high prices are the reasons why many decide to locate to the quiet suburbs, like family-friendly Orange County, Brentwood and Sherman Oaks while others can stand the prices and crowds and opt for the more riveting Silver Lake, Echo Park and downtown core.

Now that we've made our way to talking about money...Quality of life for an animator—or anyone for that matter—in LA comes down to salary and creativity. The lower the salary the higher your spending creativity needs to be. Luckily—animators are naturally creative. Animator salaries in LA can range anywhere from the mid $60,000s to low $100,000s, with the average floating in the high $70,000s mark, a decent salary and definitely liveable, although this salary combined with the overall cost of living means that your first few years in the city will likely be tough. Those who stick it out however, swear there is no better place to work in the industry, and the wages do get better.If you're thinking about relocating try this LA-based relocation calculator.

If you are considering relocating—be warned: transplants aren't the only ones vying for the coveted studio jobs. There is a great pool of local candidates that graduate from the city's many, many, many post-secondary institutions. Many of which focus on the entertainment industry. The cream of LA's animation-education flock are those coming from CalArt's animation program—a program that we ranked #2 on our list of the Top 100 Schools for Animation, Gaming and Design. The Gnomon Institute of Visual Effects (#21) in Hollywood is of course another popular recruiting ground for the majors looking for fresh young talent.
