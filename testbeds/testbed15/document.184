Computer Generated Imagery

Computer generated imagery (CGI) is used to create photo-realistic images and video using 3D software.  It can be used to illustrate concepts that would normally be impossible to capture on film, for example a product that has yet to be built, mechanical processes or biological processes at a cellular level.  The 3D visualisation created can be as simple as animated logos or as complex as video games

Computer generated imagery is more cost effective than traditional photography as

there are no travel costs, props or lighting to worry about.  At Darkside Studios, we have green screen facilities to place objects or people ‘on location’ without having to leave the studio.  The joy with CGI is that your project is not restricted by reality, there are no limits to what can be created.

Computer generated images are created starting with 3D wireframe models.  Next, properties such as highlights, transparency, and reflection are assigned to the wireframe models.  We then animate the image using camera, objects, lights, and so forth.  The last step is to render the scene.  This technology is used to create fantasy images and computer game graphics as well as special FX for use in movies.  It is easily translated into prototype product mock ups, architectural walkthroughs, and marketing communications.

Using CGI is a dynamic way to market your business and helps you to get your messages across persuasively and with clarity.  3D animation can be used to show unique benefits of a product or how it works.  We can insert digital assets into a particular environment or background for illustrative and creative purposes.  Contact us today to learn how Darkside Studios could help you.
