Audiences were able to get lost in Mad Max: Fury Road because the film still had a lot of real components to it.
Movies have come a long way over the past 20 years. In the early days of CGI, filmmakers could only superimpose a computer-generated component onto a real scene, as in Terminator 2: Judgment Day. Today, they're able to generate entire sequences using computers, as in Avatar or King Kong.
What's wrong with that? Movies saturated with CGI can become too 'glossy', say some animators, and audiences are seeing right through it. 
The experience of being lost in a movie is called "suspension of disbelief": we watch a fantastical movie like Batman Begins and suspend our judgments about it being totally implausible. But what happens when CGI saturation pushes beyond what we're prepared to suspend? We're looking at you, Avengers: Age of Ultron.
The last three Star Wars movies, including 2005's <i>Star Wars III: Revenge of the Sith</i>, were criticised for an over-reliance on CGI.

Melbourne's RMIT University digital design lecturer Mark Lycette says there's "a backlash brewing" over special-effects overkill.
"CGI now it too perfect. Even if the films are grimy, it's not really real. A human knows what real dirt is and it's very easy to see fakery," Mr Lycette says.
"A lot of what you're seeing is the machine starting to dominate the creative process."
Part of the reason why this year's Mad Max: Fury Road was such awe-inspiring viewing for many people was because it struck the right mix of CGI with real vehicles, props and landscapes.
Too many filmmakers are struggling with that balance, says Mr Lycette.
"The danger is that technicians become obsessed with the tool and everything is invested in the process and not with the outcome. They lose touch with the goal and the message of the movie.
"In the end, because they don't have connection with it, the audience struggles to have to have a connection with it too."
A video uploaded to YouTube a week ago explaining 'The WETA Effect' has already been watched more than 700,000 times.

The phrase is named after Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson's Weta Digital special effects company, which is responsible for films such as the 2005 King Kong remake.
Wary of the effect of overkill, some filmmakers are reverting to more traditional approaches to creating on-screen spectacle. 
An example is the new Star Wars film, due out in December, which will ditch an overload of CGI in favour of more "practical building".
Mr Lycette warns that CGI however, is here to stay. 
Just as the first computer-animated feature-length film, Toy Story, helped audiences become comfortable with a new species of animation, audiences and filmmakers will grow accustomed to films pumped-up with special effects.
"The younger generation brought up on this stuff are very much trained visually to be comfortable with it.
"It's the older people and anyone who wasn't brought up with it who struggle with it."
