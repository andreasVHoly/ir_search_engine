The Advantages of Using CGI in Commercial Photography

Computer generated imagery (CGI), created at Shadowlight CGI, compliments the commercial photography industry. Shadowlight offers the unique ability to mimic the detailed look of a photograph, including the desired technical accuracy, texture and color of an object or scene, making it an adaptive tool for a variety of projects.

Save on Shipping, Logistical and Construction Costs

The organization of a photo shoot, including product manufacturing and logistics, travel, location contingencies and material costs shipping, as well as construction, can be cost-prohibitive in certain situations. CGI allows for entire sets to be mocked up and created on a computer screen, saving you the material costs associated with a traditional photo shoot.

Visualize a Prototype or Space Before it Exists

In the event that you do not have a physical product to photograph, CGI allows you to visualize prototypes as well as create image assets for marketing materials prior to the product launch.  With CGI, you can digitally create your products, even if they haven’t made it beyond your R&D department. Once your product has been rendered, it is completely interchangeable with existing photography or used in environments created with CGI.

You can also use CGI to help plan the design of facilities and showrooms before construction begins. A rendered image can help manufacturers, architects, designers and engineers save thousands of dollars by visualizing the space prior to constructing it.

Easily Manipulate Images to Target Different Markets

Through CGI, a full digital scene can be designed to create residential and/or commercial images that are as imaginative as you are – limitations due to size, location, architectural design and material are a thing of the past. Because CGI scenes are never taken down or disposed of, existing scenes can be repurposed months or years later and manipulated to show products or spaces with different options, such as color, product, space, design or backgrounds. This allows you to target different markets with other options that may be more appealing to that segment, without needing to rebuild the set.

It Looks as Real as the Real Thing

When done well, consumers can’t tell the difference between a real photo and a computer generated image. Can you? Take a look at the two photos below – do you know which is one is CGI and which is from one from our studio?

The answer is the first image is CGI.

Shadowlight offers photo-realistic computer generated renderings so lifelike that neither you nor your consumer can tell the difference. Take a look at our CGI gallery.
