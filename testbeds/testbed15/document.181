A (Spotty) History and Who's Who of Computer Graphics

Matthew Ward, WPI CS Department
Introduction

The impetus for this project occurred in a recent advanced graphics class, when I mentioned a particular algorithm attributed to Jim Blinn. One student innocently asked "who is Jim Blinn?" Well, after a moment of shock, I came to realize that many people working in graphics really don't have a perspective on the history of the field or who the key players are/have been (this is true, I'm sure, in most disciplines). Thus, I decided to create a brief Web-based history of the computer graphics field, which hopefully will evolve and become more complete in time. I freely admit that the information contained is not guaranteed to be correct, and welcome any additions, corrections, and embellishments.

Digital Productions - animation firm founded by John Whitney Jr. and Gary Demos, explored use of supercomputing for animation.
Evans and Sutherland - one of the first computer graphics companies, founded in 1968.
Information International, Inc. (Triple I) - produced much of early publicly seen animation in 1970's. Talents included Gary Demos, John Whitney Jr., Frank Crow, and James Blinn.
Pixar - The former computer graphics group from Lucasfilm (not to be confused with Industrial Lights and Magic, which is the special effects group). Purchased by Steve Jobs in 1986, headed by Ed Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith, later joined by Loren Carpenter, William Reeves, and John Lasseter, responsible for genesis effect in Star Trek II, The Adventures of Andre and Wally B., Luxo Jr., Red's Dream, Tin Toy (Academy award, 1988), and Toy Story. Also created Renderman, which won an Academy award in 1993.
MAGI - early player in computer animation field, formed in 1966 by Phillip Mittelman. Known for using solids and ray tracing rather than polygonal models.
Pacific Data Images - founded by Carl Rosendahl in 1980, PDI is one of the most successful computer animation production studios to date. Locomotion is one of their more impressive projects.
Ray Tracing Corporation - first company to use ray tracing for television and film production (1982). SLOW rendering back in the 80's operating on a Convex/XP vector processor (later acquired by Cray). Became multimillion dollar company. Eventually purchased in late 80s for military uses of ray tracing (radar, sonar). [entry courtesy of Greg Passmore]
