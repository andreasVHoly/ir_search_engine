Have you ever been thumbing through a magazine or scrolling through your Facebook news feed and seen an advertisement for a product where the product looks almost too perfectly placed or lighted? Odds are, it’s a 3D Computer Generated (CG) image.

CG ads have been around for a long time, and is used by companies both large and small. The benefit? It allows you to properly display your product in a controlled, highly editable surrounding without the need to worry about purchasing high-quality cameras or lights, or having to worry about outside factors affecting the scene. It also allows for abstract concepts like Lego's Jurassic Park seen here:

or some fresh cocobella in-the-moment actions:

And this only goes for your traditional image-based ads...

Let’s not forget about computer generated videos.
3D animations used in advertising allows for impossible views and angles of your product, or showing exactly how it works for its intended application. They can give you a sense of scale or magnification that you simply can’t get with your typical camera, or can simulate interaction with your product without the need for a suitable location or actor.

What’s next for the use of 3D in advertising? As we can see here from big companies like Nike, I’m betting holograms. They're a great way to get your message across in a much more impressive - and informative - fashion than the 2-dimensional methods we've been using.

 



 

Sure, it may sound like sci-fi, but it’s a real and legitimate tech solution that has been gaining huge traction and practical application in the tech sector, more so over recent years at big tech conventions like the Consumer Electronics Show (CES); see here:

 



 

And the future outlook only gets brighter. With Microsoft’s recent announcement of the Hololens, the possibilities become endless. Imagine opening your cupboard or fridge and you notice that you're out of your favorite snack or ingredient. Now imagine browsing a list of the nearest retailers that sell that product. You're in the middle of comparing prices between competitive brands when a notification pops up about one of the two options you've narrowed it down to. The article mentions a recall because of a defective batch. In a matter of minutes, you've saved yourself from possible health risks, loss of money (and time) - all without even leaving your kitchen!



 

Granted, this scenario is years down the road, but being able to anticipate and adapt with the times is what's going to make your life and business flourish in this new wealth of tech innovation. Now all we need is a droid for the household to help us deliver our holographic ads of hope.



 

Technology is becoming more and more integrated with our everyday lives, and it's very unlikely to slow down. A mere 15 years ago, we didn't have Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. Social Media itself existed as chat rooms, message boards, and around the water cooler at work. Now it's in the palm of our hand via smartphones, on our wrist via smart watches, and even integrated with headsets like Google Glass. The breadth and scale to which the industry itself has grown has been heavily affected by the accessibility brought about by all of these innovations; and with new methods of which to view and access that information, we're on the brink of a whole new vast array of accessing and utilizing that information.
