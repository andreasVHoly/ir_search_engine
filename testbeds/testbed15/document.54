My Job explained: Animator
Watching cartoons as a child opened Rob Cureton’s eyes to his dream job. Read on to find out more.

Can you tell us a bit about your job?
I primarily work as a freelance animator in the corporate sector. This involves animating video for internal communications, presentations, conference openers, stuff like that. Sometimes we will be spending weeks on a full character animation piece whereas other times we will be creating simple motion graphics around video footage.

Can you describe a typical working day?
The work day does vary from job to job. Generally though, the team will get together and go over our jobs for the day, go through any feedback from clients and share the workload out. The majority of the day is then spent in After Effects, Final Cut or Photoshop working through. I'll usually show my work to my boss throughout the day to make sure it's going in the right direction. Nothing worse than spending three hours on something and then finding out it's all wrong! At the end of the day, we'll render, edit, export and compress our day's work to send back to the clients for feedback.

Why did you choose to go into animation?
I've always loved animation as a medium. I've been drawing my whole life and I remember as a child watching cartoons and trying to work out how the layers were set up in Tom and Jerry. I fell in love with Wallace and Gromit in my early teens and so when it came to applying for university and I realised animation was a thing you could actually learn, I signed up to be the next Nick Park. Unfortunately, I was rubbish at stop-motion but instead found a fondness for traditional and cut-out animation.

What qualifications do you have?
I studied a BA in Animation at university. While a degree helps, it means nothing if you don't have a strong portfolio to back it up. Someone with no degree but lots of examples of animation and design is far more likely to get work than someone with a degree and nothing to back it up with.

What other skills do you need?
Patience! Animation is a very slow, tedious process and it's often weeks or months until you start to see your hard work paying off. You also need to be able to accept criticism. It often turns out that how you imagined a piece of animation working is not the same as how your client imagines it. You can get frustrated by this but once you learn not to be precious about your work, it becomes a lot easier.

What’s the best bit of your job?
Seeing a character I've spent weeks designing, rigging and animating come to life on screen. The problem with animation is that you never know that something is going to work until you've actually done it. There's no better feeling than playing something back after three hours of animating blind and seeing you have nailed it! It might take three or four attempts to get to this stage but it still feels amazing.

What’s the most challenging bit of your job?
Planning! Before you even START designing a character you need to be absolutely sure of everything they need to do. It's not uncommon for me to have dozens of sheets of paper on my desk with various lists of hand shapes, mouth shapes, props, backgrounds, rigging notes and diagrams that I need to work through before we can begin animating. Animation is a series of problems that need solving and figuring out what those problems might be before you find them is half of my job.

Was it hard to get your first job?
I got incredibly lucky with my first job. I had finished uni and, like many people in that position, was back at home with my parents not entirely sure what comes next. I took on a couple of tiny little jobs through friends but nothing worth talking about. After six months of this, I got a message out of the blue from a studio in London saying that a friend who had been working for them was heading off travelling and that he'd passed on my details as someone who could fill in for him while he was gone. I did a couple of jobs with them over a few months, staying with family before they offered me a long-term contract and I moved down to London permanently.

What advice would you have for people who want to follow in your footsteps?
Persevere. It's tough going but you will get there. If you're struggling to get work, start a self-initiated project and keep your skills up. No point in finally landing a job and realising you've forgotten how to do it. Go to networking events. Go to festivals. Talk to all the right people. Buy them a drink. If they offer you a drink, accept it and sit and chat with them for a while. It's amazing how often I've done this and it actually is remembered. Most importantly, enjoy it.
