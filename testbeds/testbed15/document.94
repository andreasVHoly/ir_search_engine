A Short History of Computer Animation

For an excellent, albeit Pixar-centric, history of computer graphics, see the history of computer graphics in the toystory web site.

In the Research Labs

Computer animation has been around as long as computer graphics. The University of Utah , funded by DARPA, was the early pioneer in computer graphics and produced many of the well-known names in graphics as well as most of the important early work in computer graphics. The seminal work in computer graphics is Donald Sutherland's SketchPad system. This system animated line drawings on a screen by enforcing constraints in real-time. This is a form of model-based animation and will be discussed further in the chapter that deals with that topic (Chapter V).

Also produced from the effort of the University of Utah were some early films on a walking and talking figure, an animated hand and an animated face by such folks as Ed Catmull, Frank Crow, Fred Parke, and Jim Blinn. It has only been recently that this early work in animation has actually been eclipsed.

In the late sixties Chuck Csuri was doing some pioneering work in computer animation in the Computer Graphics Research Group at The Ohio State University. A major feature of the animation that came out of Ohio State in the mid-seventies was real-time video playback from a digital disk. The hardware that took the digital information, uncompressed it on the fly and converted it into a video signal was developed by the University of North Carolina under John Staudhammer. In the early 80s, the research group became the Advanced Computing Center for Art and Design and continues to produce computer animation.

Norm Badler , at the University of Pennsylvania, was one of the first researchers addressing the problem of human figure animation. He has continued this research and has established the Center for Human Modeling and Simulation . Jack is a software package developed at the Center which supports the positioning and animation of anthropometrically valid human figures in a virtual world.

Also in the mid-seventies, at Cornell University , the Program for Computer Graphics , under the direction of Don Greenberg , generated some architectural walk-throughs of Cornell's campus.

In 1974, the first computer animated film called Hunger was produced by Rene Jodoin, and directed and animated by Peter Foldes. This effort was a 2 1/2 D system that depended heavily on object interpolation techniques. This is discussed further in the chapter that covers object interpolation algorithms (Chapter IV). Canada has been active in computer animation (and animation in general) due in large part to the National Film Board of Canada and the National Resource Council Canada .

NYIT got into graphics in a big was in the late 70s. They produced some incredible animation. Many of the people from the Utah effort contributed to the NYIT lab. The Works represents some of the early impressive pieces to come out of NYIT.

Computer Animation: Films and Videos

Early computer animation companies included Mathematical Applications Group, Inc. (MAGI), Information International Inc. (III, or Triple-I), Digital Productions, Digital Effects, Image West, Robert Abel and Associates, and Cranston-Csuri.

Current computer animation companies (who also contribute significantly to research in the area are: Pixar , Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) , Pacific Data Images (PDI) , Disney , Xaos, Rhythm & Hues , Digital Domain , Lamb & Company , Metrolight Studios , Boss Film Studios , deGraf/Wahrman , R/Greenberg Associates , Blue Sky Productions , Sony Pictures Imageworks, and Apple . (One might also include Silicon Graphics. in that list since their equipment is used so extensively for computer animation.)

Of special note, are the award winning animations which Pixar has produced, including:

Luxo Jr. (1986)- first computer animation to be nominated for an Academy Award
Red's Dream (1987)
Tin Toy (1988)- first computer animation to win an Academy Award
Knick Knack (1989)
These animations, I believe, really paved the way for computer animation to be taken as a serious enterprise. These pieces were the first fully computer generated animations to be taken seriously as animations, irrespective of the technique involved.

Early on, Computer Graphics (CG) appeared in a variety of movies in which it was used as computer graphics (that is, the CG was not intended to fool the audience into thinking it was anything other than CG). For example, Future World (1976) and Star Wars (1977, Image West) fall into this category. More recently, Lawnmower Man (1992, Pixar) which has a segment of Hollywood's view of Virtual Reality in it, used CG in the same role, although a more sophisticated example.

Tron (1982, MAGI) was a little different. The CG was still supposed to be computer-like because the action takes place inside a computer. But in this case, it was an integral part of the environment that the actions (and actors) were taking place in. The CG was used throughout the movie. It integrated computer animation with live action, but, since the action took place in a computer, the CG didn't have to look realistic (and didn't). This was the first time CG was used as an integral part of a movie.

Along the same lines of Tron in using CG to create an 'inside the computer' environment is Reboot (1995, Limelight Ltd./BLT Productions). Reboot deserves special mention as the first Saturday morning cartoon that is full three-dimensional computer-generated animation. The action takes place inside a computer so they don't have to go for 'realism'. Still, there are several human-like principle characters and they do a very impressive job.

One main use of CG has been to replace physical models. In this case, CG is used to create realistic elements which are intermixed with the live action. The Last Star Fighter (1984, Gray Demos' Digital Productions, even the Cray X-MP was in the credits) used computer animation instead of building models for special effects. The action takes place in space as well as on planets; CG was used for the scenes in space and physical models were used for the scenes on a planet. It's not hard to tell when the movie switched between CG models and physical models. There were probably 20 minutes of CG used in the movie. This was the first time CG was used as part of the live action in which it wasn't supposed to look computer generated. More recently, Apollo 13 (1995, Digital Domain) used CG models of the return vehicle from the mission. In TV-land, special note should go to Babylon 5 (1995, Newtek). Babylon 5 is the first TV show to routinely use CG models as regular features of it's sci-fi show - and it's Amiga-based.

CG is also used to create 'alien' creatures. Creatures which are supposed to be realistic, but don't have to match anything that the audience is familiar with. The Abyss (1989, ILM) is one such movie in which CG is used to effect an alien creature which is integrated with the rest of the live action. Some of the CG in Terminator II served a similar purpose as well as Casper (1995, ILM), Species (1995, Boss Film Studios), Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers (VIFX), Sexy Robot (TV Commercial, Abel)

More challenging is the use of CG to create realistic models of creatures that are familiar to the audience. Jurassic Park (1993, ILM) was the first to completely integrate use of CG character animation in which the graphics were designed so as to blend in with the live action so that it was difficult to tell what was computer generated and what wasn't. Jumanji (1995, ILM) does the same thing with it's incredible modeling of animals. To a lesser extent, Batman Returns (1995, Digital Domain) also does the same thing by providing 'stunt doubles' of Batman in a few scenes. CG was used to create the face of RoboCop 2 (1990, deGraf/Wahrman) and animated skeletons in Total Recall (Metrolight) as well.

Another popular CG technique for special effects is the use of particle systems. One of the best examples is in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (LucasFilm - progenitor of ILM) in which a wall of fire sweeps over the surface of a planet. Another example is Lawnmower Man in which a character disintegrates into a swirl of small balls. A more recent example from television is in the opening sequence of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1995) to model a comet's tail. A movie soon to be released is called Twister which also uses particle systems.

Of course, one use of computer animation is simply to 'do animation.' By that I mean that is it used to produce animated pieces that would otherwise be done by more traditional means - essentially 3D cartoons (although that term cheapens the idea somewhat). The Pixar animations have been previously mentioned. Technological Threat was an early animation that combined computer animation with hand-drawn animation to produce an entertaining piece. TV commercials, for the most part, fall into this category. Some popular ones come to mind: Listerine, Shell dancing cars, LifeSavers. Toy Story (1995, Pixar), the first full length fully computer-generated 3D animation, would fall into a category of 3D cartoon. See the paper on the making of Toy Story . Absolute realism is not the objective as much as doing a computer generated version of what would normally be done by traditional animation means. The previously mentioned 2 1/2 D Hunger would fall into this category, as would the TV episode of The Simpsons (1995, PDI) in which Homer turned into a 3D CG character and the TV special Incredible Crash Dummies (Lamb & Company).

Although I'd like to restrict my topic to 3D computer animation, I suppose that morphing should be mentioned. This is essentially a 2D procedure which warps control points of one image into the control points of another image while the images themselves are blended. In Willow (1988, ILM), ILM provided the morph of several animals. This technique was also used by ILM in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989) and Terminator 2 . PDI is known for its use of morphing in various commercials including a Plymouth Voyager commercial and an Exxon commercial in which a car changes into a tiger. Of course, morphing has gone on to become another Energizer Bunny of TV commercials - it keeps going and going and going... Full 3D morphing has to make it out of the research labs and into any production environment.

There is another class of movies in which CG plays a role - that of 'hidden special effect' (for lack of a better term). CG can be used to cover up mechanical special effects or to enhance the scene to integrate a mechanical special effect more completely. For the most part, this resides in the 2D realm and, as such, will not be the focus of this document. However, with the onset of digital techniques for 2D compositing, sequences will be routinely digitally available making them susceptible to a variety of digital post-processing techniques. For example, in True Lies (1994, Digital Domain), CG was used to erase support wires from suspended actors. In Forest Gump (1994, Digital Domain), CG was used to insert a ping pong ball in a sequence showing an extremely fast action game. In Babe (1995, Rythm & Hues), CG was used to move the mouths of animals and fill in the background uncovered by the movement. In Interview with a Vampire (1994, Digital Domain), CG was used to curl the hair of a woman during the transformation into a vampire. In this case, some of the effect was created using 3D graphics and then integrated into the scene by 2D compositing.
