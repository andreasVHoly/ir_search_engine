The Unofficial truth about the animation industry
It is almost that time of year, again,... when animation hopefuls will soon graduate from their various animation schools, and people are looking to apply for animation jobs, etc., etc.  Schooled in technique and process.  ... Yet! ...
... for these individuals, and others, there are still MANY questions about the "animation industry" that have gone...
... unanswered!!!

  Some of this will seem like information you’ve heard before, like common sense, like something someone should have sat down and told you. Maybe that’s the case, and maybe this is just affirmation of what you already know, but either way, I think you should read this.

   I realize that you might not be a full-time student, and you might be working in the industry. In fact, some of you I know from work, and you’re just here to brush up or learn a new skill. Your continued education is evidence of the dedication you have, and that’s such a great thing to have! I admire those who want more when they already have what they need.

   I believe that no matter what and where you choose to learn, be it at a public institute, a private school, or even in front of your computer at home, you should feel comfortable with your decision. You should feel like you're learning and that you've been given the tools you need to succeed in this extremely tough industry.

Do you need to go to college to get a job in this industry?
  --- No, but it doesn't hurt your chances to have a degree, and it won't be frowned upon if you don't.

Do employers require a degree to get a job?
--- Yes, some of the larger studios do require a degree for some of their more advanced TD, software engineering, and infrastructure related jobs.

What about non technical jobs, do those require a degree?
--- No. While some schools hold a certain amount of clout with many large studios and their degrees are in fact well respected, like Ringling or Cal Arts for example, artistic jobs do not require a degree.
(Blogger's note: "And of course Animation Mentor")

Do I need to be artistic?
--- Yes. Hands down it all comes down to your natural, raw, artistic talent, your eye for detail, your ability to take criticism for your own work, and your ability to critique others. 

What if I’m technical though, do I still need to be artistic?
--- At the end of the day, the answer is yes. While it’s acceptable to not have any artistic talent and be completely scientific in many of the job functions, if you truly want to excel in Computer Graphics, you need at least basic artistic abilities to get by. It will only make you a stronger technical candidate.

So should I go to college or not?
--- Are you talented enough to get a job without it? Are you completely sure about your artistic ability and what you want to do? Do you need more time to work on your portfolio? Do you have the discipline and determination to get a job with your current abilities? Keep asking yourself questions, and eventually you’ll figure it out.

What if I get a degree in something else?
--- That’s fine if you want to have something to “fall back” on, so to speak. Conservative people recommend this option to avoid pigeonholing yourself. I personally think that you should get a degree in whatever it is you want to do as a career. You can minor in something else, like business, while still majoring in art or computer science, for example. Either way, it’s not a bad thing, but it does raise a question as to how determined are you to make it in this industry if you’re already making a backup plan?

How do I know if I am getting what I need out of school or not?
--- “I feel lost…” I’ve heard that one a lot. I honestly want to tell you to consider doing something else with your life if you feel lost and are already taking classes for your major. If you’re just wondering whether or not you’re getting what you need from school, then you should probably ask yourself what it is you expect. You’re only going to get out of it what you put in.

Should I focus on art or science?
--- That’s for you to decide. Unless you’re absolutely sure you want a technical job that requires a degree, the B.A. vs B.S. is not worth arguing over. You need to pick something that fits your goals, but remember that it’s probably irrelevant later on anyways.

My school seems more interested in my money, is this normal?
--- Many schools are cashing in on students desire to learn. They are almost all the same as far as what you end up with on paper. As far as actual teaching quality, instructor experience, and overall reputation, that all depends on your school.

If you feel like your school is just seeking a profit, then your hunch is right, it is. The difference will be in the graduating students. Look at where grads are working, not so called “job placement” numbers that the school puts out. Just remember, it’s your responsibility to teach yourself and get a job, not anyone else, no matter how much money you spend on school or how much they promise to help after graduation.

What software should I learn?
--- First and foremost, forget about the software for a minute. If you are interested in the technical side of things, then you are going to need a strong background in math and science. You'll also need programming experience. 

If you're mainly an artist then you need to focus on traditional skills such as drawing, painting, and sculpting, among other things. Work on your 2D skills before trying your hand at 3D.

The software is only a tool.

To answer the question though, the software most commonly used for 3D in the industry is Maya and 3DSMax. PhotoShop is a standard application to know. For compositing you're best bet is to learn Nuke. For rendering, Renderman and Mental Ray have the strongest markets. Houdini and 3DSMax are popular with FX artists. Also, many larger studios have proprietary packages that are very unique to their pipeline. 

It can matter what software you learn, because they are complicated packages that require training and time to understand. The less experience you have with the most commonly used software, the less valuable you will be.

I am about to graduate, what should I do?
--- There are a few steps to preparing for graduation and entering this industry.



Look at job openings and preparing your resume
Put together an online portfolio and/or demo reel
Make contacts who can review your work
What should I have when I graduate?
--- The most important thing you need is a demo reel and online portfolio with your work on it. You need a resume, obviously. Almost everyone gets reviewed solely on their demo reel, so, you’re going to need that demo reel. If you don’t have that when you graduate then you essentially have nothing to get a job with!

I graduated, now what?
--- Now is when you flood the market. You are new, you are unknown, and you need a job. Flood is the key word here. Send out as many hard copy reels and e-mails as you can. Take time and make cover letters for each one, and make them specific to each company. Don’t write generic cover letters. Don’t overdo it either, simple and to the point. Cover letter, resume, and demo reel, 3 things, that’s it.

As far as demo reels go, here are my rules:
3 minutes or less, anything more is too long
Your best work goes first, never repeat anything
Don't focus on your soundtrack, it’s on mute, sorry.
Name, phone and email all over the place, don’t forget contact info.
What to put on it?
--- Only your best work. If you don’t think it’s great, no-one else will. 
You should really get as much feedback from people as you can before you cut your demo reel. You need to find out what your best work really is. It could be that one piece that is really great that gets you a job, but if you throw in five others that are terrible, forget it.

Tailor your reel to the job that you would like.
  --- If you’re a modeler, show models. If you want to animate, show animations. Don’t try to show more than one or two skills, even if you want to do everything. You cannot possibly be good at everything, and your weakest areas are going to shine through, not your strongest. Be aware that all of your work shown is being judged, not just what you say you want to do. Not fair? Then don’t put it on your reel!

How much is your demo reel worth?
--- Technically, it’s priceless. A foot in the door in this industry is tough to get, and you are up against many willing and talented people who want that opportunity as bad if not worse than you do. So, it’s priceless. If you spend one week hacking together a reel, it’s obvious. All the talent in the world won’t make up for rushed work, laziness, or procrastination. Be proactive, and don’t doubt for a second – there is competition.

So, how much money can you make?
  --- It depends on the market that you’re in. Let’s take LA for example. An entry level artist at a 3D job might work for anywhere between $18 and $22 an hour, depending on the company, the work required, and your negotiating skills. That could be a 3D tracker, modeler, character TD, animator, lighter, or even a compositor. At this point, it’s almost all the same; you’re looking at equal pay across the board for most entry level jobs.

What if I don’t get a job right away?
--- That’s normal! You’re going to have to keep trying, and be persistent. Keep applying, keep making phone calls, writing e-mails, and keep refining your reel. Cut a new version of your reel every week if you have to, just keep making it better and better until you get that first job. The first job is so important and so hard to get, you have to really want it.

How long does it take to hear back once you’ve applied?
--- Unless they’re interested, you won’t hear anything. If they are, usually a couple of weeks at most unless there’s an enormous amount of candidates or someone else fell through. Calling HR a week after is acceptable, but don’t call everyday.

It’s been a really long time, should I send in another reel? --- Call them first, ask them what the status is of the position. Ask if you can reapply. If they say yes, then go for it! If not, then don’t waste the postage.

I got an interview…so what do I say?
Just be yourself, take extra reels and resumes and be on time and prepared. Most importantly, be honest; don’t lie about what you can do. Don’t dress up, but at least look presentable. Be confident, they’re interested in you; try to sound interested in them.
