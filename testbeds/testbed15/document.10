The History and Evolution of Computer Generated Imagery
Allison Slaton

Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) uses computer graphics to create images in art, printed media, video games, films, television programs, commercials, and simulators. The term "CGI" generally refers to 3D computer graphics used for creating scenes or special effects in films and television, but the visual scenes can also be dynamic or static or 2D. They can even be used by a home user and edited together with other programs. 
The very first movie to use computer animations is a ten minute film by Charles Csuri and James Shaffer. The film shows lines come together into a drawing of a hummingbird. The sequence of movements, which consisted of over 30,000 images and about 25 motion sequences, was generated by the computer and programmed to bring the bird to life. Check it out:

Shortly after this short film was created, a group of Russian mathematicians and physicists used a computer program to create a mathematical model of a moving cat. The program allowed them to print hundreds of frames that were later converted to film. Look at this cool cat...

In the 1970s, many more films were created using CGI. Producers were experimenting with 2D animation by using new inventions like keyframe animation software.

The very first feature film to use 2D animation is Westworld, a 1973 science fiction-thriller.

In 1976, Futureworld premiered with the first used of 3D computer graphics for animated hands and faces. Watch how the hands move around from all angles, and see how the face comes together and looks so real:

Now we get into the cool, more recognized films at the end of this decade; 3D animations were used in some of our favorite older films, such as Alien, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, and Superman. Wire-frame models and graphics were used in many sequences of these movies, even the title sequence.

It's fascinating how this character was created. The actress, Susan Dey, had her body scanned, and this digitization of her was transformed into a computer-generated simulation. 
All through the 80s, people found new ways to apply Computer Generated Imagery to film. New graphic techniques were created and used in many different ways. For example, fractal-generated landscape, facial animation, extensive 3D CGI, integrated CGI, motion blur effects, and squash and stretch motion were all used in parts of films and even throughout whole movies. Eventually an all-CGI-animated-short was made. This film is called The Adventures of Andre and Wally B.

Andre and Wally B. have come a long way from the 2D animations and sketches of hummingbirds!
The editing skills go even farther in the next couple of years. The CGI characters are now expressing emotions through face and body language. Realistic CGI animals, shadows and water effects are also included in films. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home uses the Cyberware 3D Scanner and 3D morphing. The scanner produced the actors' heads as disembodied cyber-sculptures. This technology scans complex objects and produces a data set and texture map of the surfaces. 
CGI spread to other forms of entertainment, such as television series, game shows, and even music videos. This is the very first computer generated music video for the song, Money for Nothing by Dire Straits. The animators later founded Mainframe Entertainment.

Moving into 90s, details were tweaked and perfected even more in CGI. Matte paintings were digitally manipulated, and photorealistic fire, water, fur, and creatures were introduced. Live actors can now interact with CGI characters, and "digital puppetry" is used to create a character in a film.

The following videos show some behind the scenes creations and character designs for Toy Story. The first video shows how the characters evolved from a simple sketch on paper to the complex computer generated characters they are recognized as today. The second video explains the use of CGI as a cinematic tool in Toy Story, and how the technologies were applied in comparison to other movies of this time.

In 2000, films and television shows (Jimmy Neutron) are beginning to use performance capture and off-the-shelf hardware and software. AI, artificial intelligence, is now being used as digital actors in movies like The Lord of the Rings. CGI has advanced significantly over the years and is now even used for every aspect of some films. For example, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow used all CGI live actors and backgrounds. 
Director James Cameron and his team developed the first Virtual Art Department (VAD) and complete Virtual Production pipeline to create the film, Avatar in real-time. Avatar was the first full length movie made using performance-capture to create photorealistic 3D characters. It is also the first to feature a fully CG 3D photorealistic world. Isn't that amazing? We have gone from putting 2D drawings in the computer as 3D shapes to creating an entire computer generated world!

CGI is used in almost every film that is released today. The earlier techniques have lived through the decades and continue to be used along with new techniques also being applied to films. The CGI feature-length movie, Toy Story 3, grossed over $1,000,000,000. Coronation Street Live (2010) used CGI in a live broadcast. The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey was filmed at High Frame Rate (HFR). The industry standard projection frame rate is 24 frames per second, so HFR uses an even higher frame rate for filming and projecting; The Hobbit used double (48) frames per second. Criticisms of HFR say that the "cinematic look" is lost with this format and that it looks like video games.

Computer Generated Imagery is the dominant form of special effects. The technology has progressed so far that the virtual stunt doubles can't even be distinguished from the actual actors. CGI is more efficient and cheaper than any other form of special effects, such as physical methods and models. The technology allows the creation and modification of images that other forms can't reach. The field of 3D computer graphics has already allowed us to create a virtual world, so it is certainly able to have an even more opportunistic future. Options are limitless with Computer Generated Imagery.
