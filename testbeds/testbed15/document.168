Social, Ethical, and Legal Issues in Computer Graphics

Recognizing the importance of computer science an inquisitive being might ponder the changes it has brought to society: life-style, legal and ethical issues, and knowledge advancement. Contemplating these subjects in computer graphics can lead to many interesting discussions.

Changes in life-style

Few would quarrel with the statement that computers have brought changes in our lifestyle. Whether or not these are good or bad is however a contentious subject. There are several contributions graphics has made that have changed the way we live.

The use of computer generated effects in movies is one area where graphics has had a significant role. Synthetic actors are forming guilds ;o) Computer art, although it has not replaced the palette and chisel, is becoming a medium that artist are exploring and creating significant new work.

Some are predicting that virtual reality will become the dope of the brave new world. Will be plug in and tune out or turn on using computer generated images and sound in the not to distant future?

Of course, we can not get by without discussing sex, more specifically pornography which is rampant on the Internet and supported by techniques developed by the computer graphics community.

Computer graphics have also played a fundamental role in improving medicine and diagnosis of illnesses.

Legal Issues

One legal issue that has arisen recently and is related to computer graphics is Microsoft's Antitrust trial. The government claims Microsoft stifled Intel's work on signal processing and graphics software and attempted to leash Apple's Quicktime. The Findings of Fact from the Microsoft Antitrust Trial at URL http://www.usdoj.gov/atr/cases/f3800/msjudgex.htm discusses these issues, in particular check out paragraphs 94-110.

On a separate track, attorneys have begun to use computer simulations with graphical recreation of crime scenes to provide better explanations to juries. There are several legal issue that can arise by using graphics in this way: How accurate are the simulations? Have they been enhanced (perhaps speculated graphic violence or audio) to project a particular point of view? Who controls the content of these simulations?

Ethical Issues

From the very beginning (Whirlwind and SAGE) computer graphics has been used by the military to prepare for or defend against war. Modern weaponry depends on computer generated images.

Violence in computer games is another issue that has been in the news. Shooting as schools and violent acts by youngsters have cause many to speculate that playing violent video games has been a leading cause of these violent acts.

Advancement of Knowledge

Computers have augmented the rapid accumulation of information and an awareness of the world and universe in which we live. This increased understanding is evident in the physical sciences (physics, biology, chemistry, medicine) and social sciences (economics, anthropology, environmental studies). Computer graphics, and in particular, scientific visualization has been critical in furthering our understanding by providing us with pictures, images, and animations that show how events unfold in scientific simulations.

Jim Blinn got his start (well, maybe he was already going) at JPL with his simulations of planetary fly-bys in the late 70's. Other researcher routinely use computer graphics to help verify theories, predict new results, or to make hypotheses.

Problems Related to Ethics

1.
When Fussell and Fournier first discussed the use of fractals in the creation of special effects for movies, Mandelbrot countered that they were not his true mathematical fractals, but crude approximations. How do you respond to the slogan ``if it looks good, do it'' that describes how many computer graphics effects are not based on good science but good viewing?
2.
Should a computer programmer be held responsible for the development of a program that is used in medicine and leads to the mis-diagnosis of an illness? Write a paper on your opinion.
3.
What is your view of censorship on the Internet? Write a paper discussing the issue.
4.
Based on your reading of the findings of fact in the Microsoft antitrust trail and other research, write an essay that debates the issues related to Intel's work on signal processing and graphics software or Apple's Quicktime product.
5.
What is your opinion on violent computer graphics games? Write a paper discussing the issue.
6.
Should graphics simulations be allowed in trials? Defend your views.
7.
Explore how computer graphics are used to advance science and engineering. Write a paper on the subject.
8.
As a computer graphicists how would you feel if your inventions or code were used by the military?
