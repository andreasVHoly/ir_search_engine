1941

Although the punched card was first used in 1801 to control textile looms, they were first used as an input medium for “computing machines” in 1941. Special typewriter-like devices were used to punch holes through sheets of think paper. These sheets could then be read (usually by optically based machines) by computers. They were the first input device to load programs into computers.

Salustri used punched cards in 1980 in his first-year Introduction to Computing course at the University of Toronto.

Ben Laposky created the first graphic images, an Oscilloscope, generated by an electronic (analog) machine. The image was produced by manipulating electronic beams and recording them onto high-speed film.

The Whirlwind computer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was the first computer with a video display of real time data.

1960

Although known since the 1940's, the first serious work on finite element methods of analysis is now published. FEA allows us to test products virtually and produce results that are as accurate as physical tests - at far less cost and time. The results of such an analysis was, back then, hundreds of pages of numbers that humans had to interpret. These days, thanks to computer graphics, we can literally see what would happen to our products in real-time.

Fil Salustri was born.
The first video game, SpaceWar, ran using an oscilloscope as a display.
Oscilloscopes are vector displays.
Ivan Sutherland writes the first computer drawing program - SketchPad - which included things like pop-up menus.
To generate one GFLOPS1) of processing power with 1961 technology, you would need to spend over $8 trillion (in 2013-adjusted US dollars).

AutoCAD 1.0 is released - it uses wireframe representation only.
SDRC I-deas CAD package released.
Voelcker introduces the notion of a voxel.
The Apple Lisa was a fantastic computer that failed. The Lisa was first introduced at a cost of 9,995US(9,995US(20,893 in 2007 dollars). It was one of the first commercial personal computers to have a GUI and a mouse. It used a Motorola 68000 CPU at a 5 MHz clock rate and had 512 KB or 1 MB RAM. This made it a quantum leap in technology.
But it was so innovative that it was wrong2). It simulated hardware in software, so it's very powerful CPU seemed slow to users. Also, there was no real software for it - it was in some ways too powerful. And it was certainly too expensive.

To generate one GFLOPS of processing power, you would need to spend over $30 million in 2013-adjusted US dollars. (Compare that to the 1961 data.)
The original Macintosh was in many ways a “stripped down” Lisa. It had 20% of the base memory of the Lisa, but it ran faster because it used conventional hardware configurations. In the design of the Macintosh, Apple recognized that computational power was only one of many aspects of computer use by humans and that if they wanted a good design, they would have to satisfy human nature.
The Macintosh set a new standard for computer design, and for design in general. This went to the point of establishing Apple as the “anti-IBM” (these days, the anti-PC) with a television advertisement originally aired during Superbowl XVIII3).
