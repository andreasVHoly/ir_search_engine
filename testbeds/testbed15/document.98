The 5 Types of Animation – A Beginner’s Guide
What Is This Guide About?
The purpose of this guide is to, well, guide you through the intricacies of becoming an animator.


Traditional animation
Traditional animation, sometimes referred to as cel animation, is one of the older forms of animation, in it the animator draws every frame to create the animation sequence. Just like they used to do in the old days of Disney. If you’ve ever had one of those flip-books when you were a kid, you’ll know what I mean. Sequential drawings screened quickly one after another create the illusion of movement.

“There’s always room out there for the hand-drawn image. I personally like the imperfection of hand drawing as opposed to the slick look of computer animation.”
Matt Groening
About Traditional Animation
In traditional animation, animators will draw images on a transparent piece of paper fitted on a peg using a colored pencil, one frame at the time. Animators will usually do test animations with very rough characters to see how many frames they would need to draw for the action to be properly perceived. Timing is extremely important in traditional animation, since the frames has to fit the soundtracks exactly, as such the animation process of traditional animation can be lengthy and costly. Once the clean-up and in-between are complete, the production would step over to photographing each individual frame.

History
The history of animation can be stretched as far back as 5.000BC, if you are lenient on the techniques of the art form, found on a pottery bowl in Iran that depicts a goat leaping.

The techniques of animation that we are more familiar with, however, first appeared in 1650 as The Magic Lantern, by the Venetian inventor Giovanni Fontana. Whether or not he truly is the inventor is still highly debated. A simple lantern with a strip of animation sliding past a crude lens, illuminated by a single candle, was the humankind’s first introduction to projection. Which was primarily used to scare people witless with images of devilish creatures running on the wall, and generally play on people’s superstitions.

Many more inventions came along, such as the Phenakistoscope and Zoetrope, but the first projection of animation on a screen came in 1877 with the Praxinoscope, invented by the French science teacher Charles-Émile Reynaud. He then later invented the Théâtre Optique in 1888, which he then used to stage the first public screening of animation at the Musée Grévin in Paris in 1892.

There he screened the animated short Pauvre Pierrot, which is notable for being the first time film perforations was used, and also for having the animation drawn directly on the frames instead of photographed.

The first film recorded on a filmstrip was made in 1900, which also included animated sequences where J. Stuart Blackton draws a man on a aisle holding a bottle of wine, and  then the man grabs the bottle. Blackton then followed it up five years later with the Humoureous Phases of Funny Faces, which cemented J.Stuart Blackton as the forefather of American animation.

Stepping to France in 1908, we saw the worlds first fully animated film, made by the French artist Émile Cohl. The film was called Fantasmagorie, which contained stick figures encountering various inanimate objects that they interact with.

As the 1910’s rolled around, studio produced animations came into fruition with the newspaper cartoonist Winsor McCay, who directed several animated shorts. As such, during the 1910’s animations we’re then nicknamed ‘Cartoons’. They we’re mainly produced for cinemas to as pre-show attractions before the feature film. John Randolph Bray and  Earl Hurd was the most successful animation producers of the decade, and was responsible for patenting the cel animation process, which would come to dominate the animation industry for most of the century.

Nowadays, traditional animation is being done mostly on computers by using a tablet (such as the Wacom Cintiq.) It is usually animated on 12 frames per second, with occasional faster actions animated on 24 frames per second.

2D Animation
This style has become very popular in the last decade with the increasing amount of people doing it due to the accessibility of the technology. Flash is cheap and easy to use. Such are other vector based animation programs. 2D animation can be done in After Effects too.

“Animation is different from other parts. Its language is the language of caricature. Our most difficult job was to develop the cartoon’s unnatural but seemingly natural anatomy for humans and animals.”
Walt Disney
About 2D Animation
2D animation is mostly referred to any key framed animation that is produced on a flat surface, but can also refer to vector animations that adopts the techniques of traditional animation.

Cel animation is often most thought of when talking about 2D animation, and the process is often lengthy and complicated. The technique is the same as in traditional animation, but when the animations and in-betweens are done, the frames are brought over to a process called ink-and-paint.

There the people in charge of inking and painting the frames, places a plastic sheet of celluloid on top of the transparent paper containing the animated characters, and then proceed to copy the frames on the celluloid. This way frames can overlay each other because of the complete transparency of celluloid, which makes it easier to place multiple characters and props on top of a background.

Vector based animations, meaning computer generated 2D animations, uses the exact same techniques as traditional animation, but the benefits is the lack of physical objects needed to make traditional 2D animations apart from a computer.

History
In the late 90’s, due to bandwidth restrictions, many artists started using Flash to distribute short (and very limited) animations on the web, which were usually very small in size.

That limitation gave Flash the mass appeal that made it such a huge success among independent artists and animators, which lasted to today.

Flash really skyrocketed in 2005 when it was purchased by Adobe. When YouTube started growing, it completely exploded, and today you can find thousands of Flash animations there.

The reason 2D was put in a separate category in a different category is that in addition to the option of animating frame by frame, an animator has the option of creating rigs for the characters and then moving the body parts individually instead of drawing the character over and over.

After Effects allows you to create complex rigs for animation, or use the puppet tool to drag and move body parts of a drawn character.

These flexibilities give beginners more options when approaching animation, especially if drawing isn’t their strong suit, unlike traditional animation, when drawing skills are mandatory.

3D Animation (CGI, Computer animation)
3D animation works in a completely different way than traditional animation. They both require an understanding of the same principles of movement and composition, but the technical skill set is very different for each task. while in the past you had to be an amazing draftsman to be an animator, with computer animation that is not the case. 3D animation is more similar to playing with puppets rather than drawing.

“Computers don’t create computer animation any more than a pencil creates pencil animation. What creates computer animation is the artist.”
John Lasseter
About 3D Animation
3D animation, also referred to as CGI animation, is made by generating images using computer graphics that create a series of images that forms an animation. CGI means Computer Generated Images, so it can easily mean both static and dynamic images using computer graphics.

The animation techniques of 3D animation has a lot of similarities with stop-motion animation, as they both deal with animating and posing models, and still conforms to the frame-by-frame approach of 2D animation, but is a lot more controllable since it is all digital feedback.

Instead of drawn or constructed with clay, characters in 3D animations are digitally modeled on screen, and then fitted with a ‘skeleton’ that allows animators to animate the models for their use.

Animation is done by posing the models in certain key frames, which the computer will then calculate and perform a ‘tweening’ animation that is interpreted by the computer in each frame between the key frames.

When the modeling and/or animation is complete, the computer has to render each frame individually, which unlike 2D or stop-motion animations, can be very time consuming depending on the quality of the images and the quantity of polygons in the scene.

a 3D animator will spend most of their time looking at curves that represent the movement of different body parts over time.

Another big difference with 3D animation is that unlike traditional animation, the character’s body parts are always present and should be taken to consideration.

I’ll explain:

When animating in 2D, the character has to be drawn from every frame. When the character is viewed from the side, half of its body isn’t shown and thus isn’t drawn. It technically doesn’t exist. It’s drawn on a flat page and there isn’t really more of the character other than what the animator draws.

With 3D though, the character’s body parts always exist in the shot. Even when one hand isn’t visible, it’s still there. That adds some work for the animator, since we need to be aware of the entire character at all times.

The last major difference with 3D animation is the frame rate. Traditional animators usually work on 2’s which means they draw a new drawing every 2 frames, and thus having one drawing last for 2 frames. With 3D animation, however, the motion is always smooth (except for stylized pieces which intentionally try to look different) and having a character stop completely looks like a mistake.

Even when the character is standing still there should always be some sign of life or gentle movement to keep the illusion of life, this is something 2D animation can get away with much more easily than 3D animation.

History
3D animation has definitely revolutionized how the animation industry looks today, and it was all started with Toy Story (1995, Lassetter.) Computer generated animations wasn’t completely new at the time, since it had already been often used in TV shows, movies and computer games, but Toy Story set the bar by being the first feature-length computer animation, leading to a whole new industry and market.    

3D animation also lead to studios trying to achieve photo-realistic animations by combining high-level computer processing with advance motion-capture. This has led to films such as Final Fantasy: Spirits Within (2001, Sakaguchi) and The Polar Express (2004, Zemeckis), with very mixed results. This kind of animation became rarer as the decade passed, as the process is a lot more complicated than key framed 3D animations, but has passed on to feature film VFX.
