Applicants to this programme are numerate and logically-minded, and it is likely that they will have previously studied engineering, computer science, maths or physics. They would be interested in computer graphics for games or CGI and visual effects. Graduates would seek employment in both the games and film VFX industries as game developers, animation tool developers, visual effects developers, technical directors, etc.

This programme will equip students with skills at a high academic level and also crucially enable them to practically implement their knowledge because of the ‘hands-on’ emphasis of the programme.

The main themes of the programme are:

 Current and emerging algorithms and techniques used in film visual effects and games programming
Approaches used to generate off-line visual effects
Approaches used to generate real-time interactive games
 The first theme develops in the student the necessary skills required to implement algorithms and techniques used to generate realistic scenes. These concepts will be explored in detail.

The second theme addresses the need for students to identify, evaluate and implement suitable methods to solve specific problems related to creating off-line visual effects.

The third theme recognises the need to solve these problems using approaches optimised for real-time computer games development and develops in the student the requisite skills.
