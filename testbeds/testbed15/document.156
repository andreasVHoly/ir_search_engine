As computer-generated imagery (CGI) becomes more and more prevalent in movies, some actors have openly worried that they’ll be replaced by computer programs that don’t age, don’t charge millions of dollars for their services, and don’t argue with film directors. 

So far, they have nothing to worry about. But there is one actor who has become famous for creating two very popular computer-generated characters. 

His name is Andy Serkis, and he's the British actor who played Gollum in theLord of the Rings trilogy. He also played King Kong in the 2005 remake of the classic film of the same name.

Both roles required Serkis to don what’s called a motion capture suit. That’s a tight-fitting body suit that’s outfitted with numerous reflective or magnetic sensors.

ForLord of the Rings, Serkis performed all of Gollum’s movements inside the suit. Programmers then linked these movements to a computer-generated “puppet,” using the sensors as guides. Finally, a team of 18 animators filled in the character’s physical look and facial expressions. 

For King Kong, director Peter Jackson went one step further. Jackson placed 132 digital markers on Serkis’s face, allowing his every expression to be digitally captured and then linked to the face of a giant CGI gorilla. 

Some people have criticized Serkis, claiming that his performances aren’t really “acting,” but he disagrees. To make his Kong as realistic as possible, he spent two months hanging out with gorillas in a London zoo and then traveled to Africa to interact with them in the wild!
