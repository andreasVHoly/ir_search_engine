History of animation
Looking at the past and the present, animation has evolved over time. It started with pieces of
paper and rope in 1828 and is today 3D animation videos. In this section, we will list the
chronological order of the development of animation and animation devices which have evolved
and improved over the past two centuries. We have also included the most famous animation
characters in the history of animation.
Thaumatrope
A thaumatrope (invented by Paul Roget in 1828) is a simple mechanical toy which creates
the illusion of movement. Thaumatrope means “wonder turner” derived from the Greek words:
θαῦμα “wonder” and τρόπος “turn”. Roget was the first person in history to create such a device
which produces the illusion of movement. In order to enjoy this animation, one would only need
one small round piece of paper with pictures on it and thin ropes fixed at both ends of the shape
(Figure 1). Below shows what a thaumatrope (Figure 1) is and how the illusion of movement is
produced (Figure 2).
Phenakistoscope
After the invention of the thaumatrope, the phenakistoscope followed made possible by
J.A. Ferdinand Plateau in 1832. This device uses the persistence of vision principle to create an
illusion of movement. Phenakistoscope originated from the Greek φενακίζειν (phenakizein),
meaning "to trick or cheat"; as it tricks the eye by making the figures in the pictures appear to
move. It is composed of six similar images in different positions taken in order to relay the
movement. A very simple example is a running reindeer and jumping frogs (Figure 3).
Zoetrope 
In 1843, William Horner, a British mathematician invented the zoetrope. A zoetrope
produces an illusion of movement from a rapid succession of static pictures. Derived from the
Greek words ζωήzoe, "life" and τρόπος tropos, "turn" this forms a “wheel of life”.
Praxinoscope
Almost the same as a zoetrope, the only difference was the integration of a mirror to the
device which makes the viewer more comfortable as they watch the movement of the objects. It
was designed by Emile Reynaud in 1877 and was known as the “action viewer”.
Kinestoscope
An early motion picture exhibition device was invented in 1888 by Thomas Edison
together with his colleague Eadweard Muybridge. The kinestoscope was designed for films to be
viewed through the window of a cabinet (Figure 6). Kinestoscope means the “view of
movement” from the Greek words κίνησις “movement” and σκοπός “movement”.
Multiplane Camera and Storyboard 
Walt Disney and his colleagues had a problem with creating realistic animation and how
to conserve time while creating it. Then they came up with a great solution which can be
considered another innovation in the field of animation - the multiplane camera (Figure 12).
The multiplane camera is a piece of equipment designed to make cartoons more realistic and
enjoyable. It uses stacked panes of glass each with different elements of the animation
(Figure 13). With this, it allowed for the reuse of backgrounds, foregrounds, or any elements
not in motion. The multiplane camera was developed by a Walt Disney Productions team
headed by William Garity in the early 1930s. It was also known as the “super cartoon
camera”.
The storyboard was yet another successful creation in animation technology. It is used to
recheck the story and utilizes pencil sketches to review motion.
Next we will discuss the first ever animated films together with some of the most famous
and successful animation characters. Outstanding works in stop motion and clay motion are
also elucidated, followed by a discussion of computer graphics and computer animation, i.e.,
3D animation.
Humorous Phases of Funny Faces
After the invention of the above-mentioned devices, J. Stuart Blackton made the first
animated film in 1906. The film was entitled Humorous Phases of Funny Faces, and with
this he became known as the father of animation. He was using a blackboard as his
workplace together with chalk and an eraser as his main tools. He was able to record the
animation using the “draw-stop-film-erase” method. 
The Birth of Cartoon Characters
The creation of the first ever animated film also inspired many animators to create their
own animations. For instance, Winsor McCay drew Gertie, the trained dinosaur (Figure 8).
It was an animated film astonishingly consisting of 10,000 drawings. The animation was
shown as a film in theatres as well as at a multimedia event on stage with McCay interacting
with the animated Gertie. Next in line was Felix the Cat (Figure 9). During the early 1920s,
he became the most famous animated character. Then who could forget Mickey Mouse?
(Figure 10). Mickey Mouse was created on November 18, 1928 and with his creation came
the first successful sound animated film. Mickey Mouse was originally known as Steamboat
Willie (Figure 11). He became an international star and made way for the launch of Disney
Studios. Lastly, Looney Tunes was introduced in 1930 by Hugh Harman and Rudolp Ising
run by the Warner Bros. Company. Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tweety Bird and Silvester are
just a few of the main characters in this cartoon.
Stop Motion and Claymation
Stop motion animation is used to animate things that are smaller than life size. Willis
Harold O’Brian pioneered motion picture special effects, which were perfected in stop
motion. He became famous after his successful work on King Kong (Figure 14), claiming the
title Dean of Stop-action Animation. Ray Harryhausen followed in the footsteps of O’Brian
and became one of the most outstanding stop motion film makers through his films Mighty
Joe Young and The Lost World (Figure 15).
On the other hand, claymation also became a trend. Technically, it is the art of moulding
clay figures and making them move, dance, talk, sing and whatever you can think of. Frames 
are run together to produce the animation. Chicken Run and Wallace & Grommit are the two
most successful claymations created by Aarmand Studios of the United Kingdom
Computer Animation 
When it comes to new forms of animation, firstly let us define traditional animation - a
system of animating in which the illusion of movement is presented by photographing a
sequence of individual drawings on consecutive frames of film. On the other hand, computer
animation is a form of pictorial presentation which refers to simulated motion pictures
showing movement of drawn objects.
Computer Graphics and 3D Animation
This is where graphics are created using computers and the illustration of image data by a
computer particularly with the help of respective graphic hardware and software such as
Superpaint. It is used to replace physical models then create realistic intermixed elements
with the live action. 3D animation is today’s animation. By using some sophisticated
software and looking at the Principles of Traditional Animation Applied to 3D Animation
concept, animators are able to produce outstanding and aesthetic animations such as, Toy
Story, Madagascar, Megamind, etc.
