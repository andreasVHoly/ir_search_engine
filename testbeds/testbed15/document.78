FdSc 3D Computer Generated Imagery
In brief... 
Computer Generated Imagery (CGI) provides significant cultural and economic contribution to the UK through games, films, TV, advertising and visualisation, and these companies are always looking for new talent. Graduates from these courses can have exciting opportunities to work on the highest grossing films and games, the funniest and cleverest adverts and some of the most creative commercial artwork around at the moment.

In 2015, Bournemouth was recognised as the fastest growing digital economy in the UK, making Bournemouth & Poole College a great place to study CGI. Our 3D CGI programme has been training students and preparing them for industry for more than a decade.

We offer two main pathways: Modelling & Animation and Architectural Visualisation. Whichever pathway you enrol on the first year is generic to provide a solid base of 3D skills and you donâ€™t need any previous experience of 3D.
Who is it for? 
Modelling & Animation is geared primarily towards character-based industries such as games, films and advertising. It includes character and prop modelling, texturing, lighting, animation, rendering and post-production and as such provides a good set of generalist skills to allow you to have the best chance of working in your dream industry. 
What courses can I do after this? 
With a Foundation Degree in Modelling & Animation and a good portfolio, graduates will typically find junior positions in VFX companies, games companies and CGI boutiques in the UK and abroad. However, your progression opportunities are increased by continuing with our BSc top-up programme which is one year with an optional placement year in industry. Many students who take placements are invited back on a permanent basis after graduating from the BSc top-up.

What jobs can I get? 
Our graduates work in over 100 different companies including many of the big games, animation and VFX studios such as Blue Zoo, Climax Studios, Codemasters, Double Negative, Exient, Framestore, Jellyfish, Lionhead Studios, MPC, Prime Focus, Rocksteady, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe and The Mill.
