Should I Become a CGI Artist?
Computer-generated imagery (CGI) is the creation of still and moving images and visual effects using computer hardware and software. CGI artists create characters, environments, objects, special effects and locations, both real and imagined. Although CGI encompasses many specialties in computer graphics, 2-D and 3-D animation and special effects, the term is most often used to refer to 3-D animations created for television, video games and film.

Many multimedia artists and animators, including CGI artists, are self-employed and therefore must spend time finding work. Although they might work long hours to meet deadlines, they often work from home or other convenient locations.

Step 1: Obtain a Degree
Degree programs are available for a wide variety of specialties, including game development, animation, and entertainment design, providing students with the opportunity to select programs closely aligned with their career goals. Students also have the opportunity to focus on the aesthetics of animation by enrolling in a fine arts degree program or on the more technical aspects by selecting a computer-related degree program. Many programs feature basic courses in graphic design, art and technology before branching off to offer specialized coursework. There are also limited degree options in CGI art, as a self-defined major.

Success Tips:

Choose a program carefully. Since there are so many sub-specialties in this field, students should carefully research degree programs to insure they select one providing coursework that aligns with their future goals.
Complete an internship. Many degree programs offer internships, which can provide on-the-job experience and networking opportunities.
Step 2: Build a Portfolio
Artists are expected to have a portfolio to show prospective employers. This is a collection of the artist's best works, showcasing his or her artistry and technical proficiency. Most degree programs require students to create a portfolio as part of their graduation requirements, but artists without a degree also need to have portfolio. Many employers require artists to submit portfolios on a CD or DVD or to provide website link.

Success Tips

Select portfolio pieces based on a potential employer's needs. Artists can tailor their portfolios to the positions for which they're applying to demonstrate their style and proficiency using the technology required by the job.
Limit the number and scope of pieces in your portfolio. The contents of a portfolio should be chosen with care and restraint to avoid overwhelming a potential employer with too much imagery or too many technical gimmicks.
Step 3: Gain Experience
Many positions require professional experience. New artists or graduates may have to accept assistant-level positions to obtain the necessary on-the-job experience to advance. This field also has many freelance opportunities available, allowing artists to commission CGI art for experience and a contract fee.

Success Tip

Volunteer locally. Volunteering to perform CGI work for schools or other nonprofit organizations can provide valuable experience. Additionally, cable access stations may seek volunteers to provide programming and production services, which can be included in an artist's portfolio.
Step 4: Complete Continuing Education Courses
Advancements in the technology used to create computer-generated imagery are incredibly dynamic. Having invested substantially in the technology, employers generally expect artists to have the technical skills and up-to-date product knowledge to maximize all the features present in software programs and hardware equipment. To stay competitive, artists can take continuing education courses offered by colleges or product vendors, including Apple, Autodesk and Adobe.

Education and experience can lead to advancement opportunities for a CGI artist. He or she may get promoted to a senior artist position, a review or editorial position, or may even lead projects. A degree and business acumen may lead to a supervisor or management position with a large enough company. Alternatively, with more experience and education, a CGI artist's skills will become more valuable on a freelance basis.
