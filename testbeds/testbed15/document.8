Get Movin’ With a Career in 3D Animation

	
What is 3D Animation?

Sometimes referred to as 3D CGI, 3D animation is a type of animation that uses computer generated images to create animated scenes. Compared to 2D animation, or traditional animation, 3D has much more depth, and it looks much more realistic.

An animated scene starts with one picture, which is referred to a frame. The next frame is a picture that is slightly advanced a few milliseconds in time. After hundreds or thousands of these frames are flashed on a screen in rapid succession, they give the illusion of a moving picture.

The majority of the animated feature movies and short animated skits today are created with 3D animation, and this is a rapidly growing industry.

What Does a 3D Animator Do?

A career in 3D animation involves creating 3D moving images using computer software. These images are made with the use of digital models. After the models have been created, details are added, like hair, clothing, skin, grass, trees, and any other item that completes a scene.

The types of animations that 3D animators create can vary. Some 3D animators create long feature movies, for instance. Others may create shorter animations, like short skits, which can be used for advertisements or website animations. Some 3D animators specialize in creating animations for video games, and others create special effects for live action motion pictures.

Depending on an animator’s area of expertise, he might also specialize in creating different aspects of an animation. For instance, one animator may create animated people, while others will help complete the background animation, like landscapes and buildings.

3D animators also work with several different people when creating an animated scene. For instance, they will often work with writers and directors. They must also coordinate the animated action with voice actors and music directors.

What is the Annual Salary for a 3D Animator?

3D animation is one of the fastest growing careers. Since most animated scenes are now created with this type of technology, the demand for this type of technical knowledge is increasing. The average salary for 3D animators reflects this.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 3D animators made roughly a median salary of $58,510 annually. Some more successful  (top 90+ percentile) 3D animators have the capacity to make over $100,000 each year depending on industry working in and state living within.

What are the Education Requirements For a Career in 3D Animation?

3D animation is a technical career that requires specialized knowledge. Because of this, individuals looking to break into a career in 3D animation usually need to complete at least four years of post-secondary education. Some animators may further their education even more and earn a master’s degree in 3D animation. Research animation schools  and online animation programs today.

To earn a degree in this area, students will usually need to take a combination of art and computer courses, as well as courses in anatomy and natural sciences.
