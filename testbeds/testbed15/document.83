Beware of the uncanny valley
Computer-generated imagery works great for background special effects. But applied to the heroes of the story, it often gets too close for comfort. When animators attempt to bridge the gap between cartoon characters and live actors by creating ultra-lifelike human forms, their facsimiles frequently fall into a spooky region known to C.G.I. experts as the "uncanny valley." The characters seem at once human and alien, causing cognitive dissonance that settles into a feeling of fear or repulsion.
Recall (with a shudder) the 2007 film "Beowulf," in which the monster Grendel was "only slightly scarier" than "closeups of our human hero Beowulf's face," according to David Gallagher of The Times. Fearing such an effect, many animation studios steer clear of the uncanny valley altogether and prefer to place cartoonish humans amid more realistic surroundings, as in the Oscar-winning Pixar film "Brave." But the disconnect between characters and landscape can break a film's illusion, too.
Scientists find that the uncanny valley effect is elicited most strongly by characters that are highly realistic in some aspects but not others. Proportional facial features seem eeriest on faces lacking detailed skin, for example, whereas disproportionate features are more disturbing on photo-realistic faces. Psychologists have suggested that these mismatches might raise red flags because we are able to perceive subtle deviations from what we consider to be healthy or attractive in human beings. We then respond to these creatures evolutionarily, as we would toward a diseased or reproductively unfit stranger.
If experts can pinpoint and eliminate the creep factor, C.G.I. promises to replace an arguably even creepier element of film: cosmetically aged actors. They look weird to the point of distraction, and can sometimes limit a filmmaker's ability to tell stories that span decades. Computerized age progression could be the solution. In fact, C.G.I. experts I've interviewed count the 80-year-old digital double of Brad Pitt in "Benjamin Button" among their field's greatest triumphs.
