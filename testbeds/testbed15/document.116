A realistic camera model for computer graphics
Most recent rendering research has concentrated on two subproblems:
modeling the reflection of light from materials, and calculating
the direct and indirect illumination from light sources and other
surfaces. Another key component of a rendering system is the camera
model. Unfortunately, current camera models are not geometrically
or radiometrically correct and thus are not sufficient for synthesizing
images from physically-based rendering programs.
In this paper we describe a physically-based camera model for
computer graphics. More precisely, a physically-based camera
model accurately computes the irradiance on the film given the incoming
radiance from the scene. In our model a camera is described
as a lens system and film backplane. The lens system consists of a
sequence of simple lens elements, stops and apertures. The camera
simulation module computes the irradiance on the backplane from
the scene radiances using distributed ray tracing. This is accomplished
by a detailed simulation of the geometry of ray paths through
the lens system, and by sampling the lens system such that the radiometry
is computed accurately and efficiently. Because even the
most complicated lenses have a relatively small number of elements,
the simulation only increases the total rendering time slightly
