he history of computer-generated imagery goes hand in hand with the history of the computer itself. Especially the arrival of the third generation of digital computers in the late 1960s helped pave the way for what later became known as CGI or special effects.



For the origins of computer-generated imagery (CGI) we need to go back to the year 1968. In this year a group of Russian mathematicians and physicists, lead by N. Konstantinov, developed a groundbreaking mathematical model that allowed them to move a cat across a screen.

The scientists turned the mathematical model into a program for a special mainframe computer with the name BESM-4. The BESM-4 computer was able to print hundreds of frames, which when processed could be converted into usable film material.



In the 1970s CGI technology really gained a foothold within the entertainment community. Just a few years after moving a cat across a screen, 2D animator Peter Foldes created the first CGI animated short film, drawn on a data tablet. Foldes also used the world’s first key frame animation software, released in the same year as the short film by Nestor Burtnyk and Marceli Wein.

Westworld CGI effect

Several months later, in 1971, the first CGI was used in a national television program. While cinema visitors in 1973 were able to watch the first 2D animated effect, namely the point of view shot in Westworld, conceived by Yul Brynner.



The first 3D computer-generated imagery was created in the film Futureworld, in 1976. In the specific scene the hand and face of the actor was enhanced with the use of CGI. Futureworld made use of so called 2D digital compositing, in order to materialize characters over the background.

Director George Lucas saw the potential of CGI as well, but in stead of taking a digital approach he choose for the implementation of a mix between analog and digital technologies. His Star Wars franchise became a major box office hit and an inspiration for many CGI effects that followed.

A large number of movies using CGI effects followed soon after Star Wars: A New Hope, showing the potential and mind boggling possibilities of what computer-generated imagery could achieve.

Superman: The Movie (1978) conceived the first computer-generated title sequence, while the movies Alien (1979) and Black Hole (1979) pushed the boundaries of CGI further once more by conceiving 3D wireframe rasters, resulting in more detailed CGI effects.



As the computer developed and became more integrated into society, CGI did as well. The 1980s saw an explosion of CGI achievements. The most important milestones included the first CGI human character (with the first use of 3D shaded CGI), the invention of the Genesis effect for creating alien-like landscapes (such as the ones used in Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Khan in 1982), TRON (1982) that depicted 15 minutes of fully rendered CGI footage (including the famous light cycle sequence), the first water 3D CGI effect in the film hit “The Abyss”  and the first digital composite in Indiana Jones: The Last Crusade (1989).

The Matrix

As we entered the age of the internet and the personal computer became mainstream, CGI effects became more photo realistic. Big innovations came with the development of movies like Terminator 2: Judgement Day, which figured 3D CGI motion pictures.

Two years later, in 1993, Steven Spielberg raised the bar by creating the first realistic computer-generated creatures in Jurassic Parc.

In 1995 Toy Story got the title of having the first fully CGI animated movie and the 1990s CGI era ended with the The Matrix (1999), which was the first movie to use the so called bullet time effect.

As the movie industry matured the game industry made its first steps in the mainstream segment as well. Fifth generation gaming consoles introduced fully 3D playable game environments to the masses. The release of the PlayStation (1994) and the  Nintendo 64 (1996) games got their first fully 3D supported gaming platforms.

Games such as Super Mario 64, Doom, Final Fantasy and Crash Bandicoot set the standard for many computer-generated games that followed.

Gollum CGI

As we entered the 21st century the possibilities for CGI became almost endless, with computer-generated imagery becoming more and more a part of authentic film footage. Movies like The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Matrix: Reloaded (2003) and The Polar Express (2004) are good examples of that development.

Lord of the Rings was the first movie to make use of artificial intelligence for its digital characters, while it also introduced the first photo realistic motion captured character with the creation of Gollum.

The Matrix: Reloaded thereby was the first movie to use a technique called “Universal Capture”, which allowed the movie to capture more frames in an image than ever before.

Furthermore, in 2004 the animated film “The Polar Express” (2004) pushed the boundaries of CGI by implementing motion capture and CGI on all of its actors.

Avatar CGI rendering

Many breakthroughs followed as we entered the realm of photo realistic CGI effects. In 2009 the creators of Avatar pushed CGI to the highest level yet, creating a movie that was entirely conceived with a technique called performance capture, transforming multiple actors into photo realistic 3D characters.

Crysis nanosuit CGI

Aside the movie industry, the gaming industry is currently implementing a multitude of computer-generated imagery techniques as well. Game series like Grand Theft Auto and Crysis have set the boundaries of CGI in games over the last several years, with an interesting detail being that games and movies are starting to show more and more similarities.

Bioware and Lucas Arts their story driven game called Star Wars: The Old Republic (scheduled for a 2011 release) is a good example of this merge between movies, animations and games.
