Cinema is about humanity, not fireballs
The question of whether computer animation has killed or enhanced the “magic” of cinema demands other questions, like:

How many more times can we tolerate digitally enhanced characters leaping into the air with their spear or knife drawn to descend superhero-like on an opponent? How many zooming overhead shots of fantasy landscapes and 360-degree panoramas can we stomach before we get dizzy? How many more villainous faces and grotesque monsters can enter our psyches before they cease to hold meaning? How many innumerable digital dots now pass for casts of millions (possibly forever superseding the quite literal “casts of thousands” from the days of “Ben-Hur")?
We’ve reached the surfeit point of limitless digital effects with limited imagination.

It should be obvious to even the most easily impressed moviegoer that the impact of the “Star Wars” and “Lord of the Rings” franchises is mostly technological and has had nothing to do with art. In this post-“Avatar” culture, Hollywood relies on digital effects to emphasize lavish other-worldly environments to give audiences what they want: escapism. But there’s also an escape from credibility happening here. Special effects used to bring us closer to realism; now they douse us in artifice. “Speed Racer,” anyone?
"Oz the Great and Powerful" has been digitized to look like a hyperactive coloring book. A prequel to "The Wizard of Oz," the movie substitutes potentially wondrous details with a certain overripeness of imagery. Technological excess has overwhelmed narrative meaning. This digital grandstanding suffocates what I -- and D.W. Griffith and Andre Bazin and past generations of theorists, critics and cinematic practitioners -- once considered the essence of cinema: nature and the human face.

The further Hollywood gets from that essence, the more computer-generated imagery we will get. “Animation Domination,” as it's advertised on the Fox network. It almost seems as if Hollywood’s emphasis on digital effects aims to turn moviegoers into children rather than aesthetically responsive viewers.

This overripeness is typical Hollywood overkill. Imagine a painter who keeps slathering on pigment. Why do we need so much color saturation? Or to put it another way: How many more fireballs must our heroes outrun?

We are suffering from digital effects overload, plain and simple.
