Volumetric Lighting
Posted on January 6, 2013
In the 3D renders below I have taken a 3D image that I had previously created and tried to improve it by adopting the techniques discussed in this blog. The main focus was to improve photorealism and experiment with volumetric lighting.

When comparing the two images it’s astonishing to think that I was pleased with my original render. It goes to show just how much I’ve learnt since starting the MA.

As mentioned above, I was using this 3D image as a vehicle for experimenting with volumetric lighting. In the improved image, I have applied many of the theories already discussed in this blog, such as adding noise, depth of field, there’s now some dirt at the bottom of the wall and dust on the shelf, but the biggest difference is the addition of atmospheric dust. You can now see the visible light penetrating the right hand side of the image, it is obscuring the model’s rear leg and creating some streaks of light/shadow as it hits the top of the model’s shell.

 Original Render Improved Render
What’s even more important in the improved render is the consideration that’s been given to the narrative. The diagonal lines, camera angle, and use of warm and cold lighting help to achieve what I had originally intended. It seems that the study of character development and cinematography have had as much impact on the improved render as the study of photorealism in 3D and CGI.
