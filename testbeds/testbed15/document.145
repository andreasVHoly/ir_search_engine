hat Does Visual Effects Mean?

Visual effects is the process of creating imagery outside of live action shoots. This imagery is typically either too elaborate or even dangerous to create for or capture on film. Some visual effects (also called F/X or VFX) combine live action and say, computer generated imagery, while others are totally computer generated. Some of the most celebrated VFX scenes can be seen in films such as The Dark Knight (2008), Iron Man (2008), Titanic (2007), and Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest (2006).
