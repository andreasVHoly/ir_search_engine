Science-fiction or science-fact? David Attenborough warns of confusing CGI in television documentaries

Computer-generated imagery in science and nature programmes is confusing viewers, David Attenborough has warned.
The veteran TV presenter admitted it has become a ‘big problem’ and suggested that broadcasters put captions to point out scenes that had been artificially reconstructed.
Sir David told the House of Lords Communications Committee his ‘misgivings’ over the use of the technology when watching controversial BBC1 biology programme Inside The Human Body.

He said: ‘If you wanted to confuse the audience, you have got more convincing ways of confusing them than ever in history.’
He added that there are ‘well known examples’ of programme-makers ‘overstepping the mark’ and giving viewers false impressions created by computer.

Computer generated tactics are used routinely in science and nature shows - but the viewer is given little guidance about the nature of the image.
One member of the committee suggested a warning dot on shows every time the practice was being used.

Sir David said problems came when people and start recreating things which they ‘think’ happened rather than know.
The natural history presenter suggested a solution, saying: ‘One of the ways to do it is, by putting on, either at the beginning or the end, a caption which says "some of the scenes and sequences that follow are computer generated", or something of that sort.’
Sir David, referring to Inside The Human Body, which showed a man’s moment of  death, but also computer generated images of disease, said: ‘I thought I don’t know, I don’t know where we are on that.‘
But he claimed it was ‘not an easy problem to solve’ as the technology could be very helpful to illustrate information.
He added: ‘The problem comes when you overstep the mark and you think you know  and you have actually put on something that is false and there are actually well-known examples of that happening. 
'The problem is much greater than it has ever been before.’ 
He pointed to an example where the body of a rare fish was photographed but  then by aid of computers you could ‘waggle’ its fins. He said the image was both ‘false’ and ‘true’ in some ways.
But he added that red dots flashing up every time the practice was used would be confusing.
