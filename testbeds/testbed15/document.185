J. Michael Stracznski, the creator of Babylon 5 which is the first TV program to use computer generated graphics, will speak at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). His encounter with computer graphics began in the early 1990’s when Ron Thornton, Foundation Imaging’s visual effects director, started working with the Commodore Amiga and New Tek’s Video Toaster, an add-on graphics card. The creators of Babylon 5 discarded the miniature, physical, static models of Star Trek for new possibilities.

The July 1994 issue of Compute!  magazine discusses the graphics used in Babylon 5. By today’s standards, it seems primitive, but it was innovative in its time. Each episode of the series used an average of 6,000 frames of computer graphic animation from Foundation Imaging. They used 24 Amiga 2000s, 16 of which were dedicated rendering engines. They had 32 megabytes of RAM, a Fusion-40 accelerator and the Toaster. The Amigas were connected via a Novell network and sent data to a 12 gigabyte 486 PC file server. They later upgraded to Pentium and Alpha-based systems.

Before the Web as we know it came to be, Straczynski hawked his upcoming show over the Internet on USENET, GEnie and Compuserve systems. Babylon’s space station was located in “Grid Epsilon” at coordinates of 470/18/22, which was a reference to GEnie and the original forum’s address on the system’s bulletin boards. Warner Bros started an official website for the TV series.

Straczynski is a writer and producer of science fiction (Babylon 5 and Twilight Zone), mysteries (Murder She Wrote), and movies (Changling, and Ninja Assassin which is coming in November, 2009). Babylon 5 portrayed themes relevant to modern and historical social issues, with subliminal undertones. The subconscious, religion, and even substance abuse and its impact on human personalities, all found a place in the stories.

Various armed conflicts took place on an interstellar scale. The entire series begins following a war caused by a misunderstanding brought on by first contact which brought the human race to the brink of extinction.

In 1997, Straczynski said that what he wanted to do was “examine the issues and emotions and events that precede a war, precipitate a war, the effects of the war itself, the end of the war and the aftermath of that war. The war is hardware, the people are at the center of the story.” These issues are still of importance today. Bablyon 5’s space station was built with the intent of fostering peace through diplomacy.

A video game exists based on the stories, and a new book authorized by Straczynski titled “Across Time and Space: The Chronologies of Babylon 5” is scheduled for release next week. His lecture,  hosted by the Comparative Media Studies Program at MIT, will take place May 22.
