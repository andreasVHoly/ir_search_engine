Recreating eyes in a CG environment, whether it’s for a human, animal or even some type of mythical creature can be a difficult task. There are some very important principles to keep in mind to ensure the eyes on your character are as believable as possible. This article will cover some key techniques for modeling and texturing realistic eyes that can be applied in any 3D application you’re using.

When it comes to the eyes of your character or creature it’s something that really can’t be overlooked, but often times it is. Sure, there are times when going for three basic colors to create the eye will work, and sometimes this is all a cartoony style character needs.

But more often than not, your character needs more detail in the eyes. So much emotion and personality can come just from the eye, that’s why it’s important that the eyes on your character are realistic.

Creating believable eyes is vital for capturing and maintaining the audience’s attention. Eyes that look unnatural can be a dead giveaway to a CG character, which you almost never want.

Find the Right Reference
As with just about every other task in a 3D production you’ll want to find great reference, and when it comes to creating realistic eyes there is no exception.

Before you begin creating the eyes you should search for some reference images online or even just snap some pictures of your own eyes. This is a great way to really study the eye and see all the small details and variety of colors that actually appear on someone’s eye.

Another very important detail you should get out of studying the right reference is to understand the anatomy of an eye. The key features you want to keep in mind are the cornea, the iris, the pupil and the sclera.

Eye Anatomy

The cornea of the eye is actually the transparent area of the eye that covers the iris and the pupil. The cornea is actually what helps give the eye its refractive nature.

Cornea

The iris of the eye is the area of the eye that gives it its unique color. The iris has very intricate details that require the most attention when creating the textures. On a technical level the iris is what controls the diameter of the pupil, but more often than not it just needs to be remembered as the “colored” part of the eye.

Iris
The pupil is the hole located in the center of the eye which allows light to enter in. Of course, you as an artist just needs to remember that the pupil is the black area in the center of the eye. One very important thing you need to keep in mind is that not all pupils are shaped circular. For instance, a cat’s pupil is typically a vertical split in the eye.

Pupil

The white area of the eye is referred to as the sclera, which acts as the protective layer of the eye. One thing you need to remember is that there are usually visible blood vessels that appear on the sclera, and if someone has an itchy eye and rubs it or if the person is tired it can increase the blood shot appearance.
