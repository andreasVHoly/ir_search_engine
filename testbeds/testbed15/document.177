Located within the Toho Studio, which is adjacent to the prestigious residential area of Setagaya, Tokyo, Picture Element Inc. (Picture Element), is a post-production company that combines live-action images with computer-generated (CG) imagery to create visual effects (VFX) for movies, television dramas, and advertisements.

"We only started using the FARO Laser Scanner Focus3D in 2013, but as of May 2014, we have since used it for five films,” explained Mr. Tetsuo Ohya, President and Technical Producer of Picture Element, who has over 30 years of experience in the filmmaking industry. “It is now essential to our work in CG modeling, synthesizing live-action with other types of images, and incorporating CG imagery into computer-animated movies.”

“We used the Focus3D for producing about 20 cuts in the movie, Kiki's Delivery Service,” revealed Mr. Toshiya Harada, Production Manager of Picture Element. “We also scanned the entire Kobe Fruit & Flower Park to create a 3D model as a backdrop for the movie, Miracle Debikuro's Love and Magic, which is currently in production.”

Point Cloud Data for A Variety of Video Productions

Data scans from the Focus3D have been used in a variety of video productions. In Kiki's Delivery Service, one of the scenes featured a CG model of a black cat named Gigi, which appeared on-screen, walked onto a real table and stone steps, then jumped off-screen. Point cloud data was used to precisely match live-action and CG imagery. The actual scene had to be measured for the CGI to match up, but curved surfaces – which were the stone steps in this case – could not be measured manually. “Scanning with the Focus3D enables us to match CG imagery of the black cat to the live-action in a precise manner,” noted Mr. Naotaro Takahashi, Digital Imaging Technician & VFX Supervisor of Picture Element.

Mr. Harada continued, “There was another scene in Miracle Debikuro's Love and Magic that showed the fruit park decorated with Christmas lights. We scanned everything at the scene with the Focus3D, including the buildings, the park, and the fountain. With that data, we created a 3D model for the video projection mapping in VFX.”

For the project at the fruit park, several separate scans had to be performed as one of the buildings in the park was U-shaped. Using the Focus3D, 12 scans were taken from various locations around the building, which were eventually stitched together to form a single set of point cloud data. 

The entire site, ranging from the terrace to the four locations around the fountain, was then scanned to create a total of 18 sets of point cloud data. As the Focus3D had a small form factor and was lightweight enough to be carried around easily, the project could be completed in just a short period of time. Mr. Harada commented, “We used the Focus3D for this project and we operated the device easily, measuring at distances of up to 120m with no issues.”

Two suites of software, FARO SCENE and Geomagic Studio, were used to process the point cloud data and create the 3D model.

Shooting in a Remote Location with Scan Fragments

In another live-action movie, Attack on Titan, the Gunkanjima (also known as Battleship Island) in Nagasaki was chosen as the film location. The island used to be occupied by coal miners but it has since become abandoned and uninhabited. Numerous scans were taken for use in the movie, and the Focus3D was instrumental in the acquisition of data for scene building later on.

Creating a 3D model of the film set with the FARO Laser Scanner Focus3D.

“Access to this site was restricted and shooting times were limited,” said Mr. Ohya. “As the structure of the buildings and terrain was complex, we could not think of any method other than to use the Focus3D under such conditions. We basically scanned everything that was on the island, because we had not decided where and how we wanted to shoot on location. Based on the point cloud data collected, we examined the fragmented shots and used the data to recreate miniature models or CG imagery.”

In other words, the point cloud data collected by the Focus3D was used as a 3D storyboard. The device’s the ability to record detailed information of a site in 3D, as well as the ability to examine scenes from various angles, are some of its unique benefits.

On a film set, the ceiling of the building may not always be suitable for a shoot. In such cases, the desired look can be synthesized into the scene in post-production using CG. As the shape of the ceiling changes with camera movement in 3D, the CG ceiling can only be synthesized realistically if a high-accuracy scan of the scene was acquired with the Focus3D beforehand.

A Chance Encounter with the Focus3D

The Focus3D is now essential to the post-production work that is done at Picture Element, but it was a scene from the DNA investigation themed movie, Platinum Data, that led the company to its discovery.

Mr. Ohya recalled, “In this movie, set in futuristic Japan, there was a scene where a laser scanner was used for forensics in the police investigation of a crime scene. The Focus3D was brought in merely as a prop on set. As video production professionals, we were more intrigued by the Focus3D than the film set. Subsequently, we actually tried the device by scanning the set. Upon checking the point cloud data, we discovered that it was a practical solution for us. That was when we decided to introduce it into our workflow.”

Today, the FARO Laser Scanner Focus3D is indispensable to Picture Element.

He continued, “For us, the challenge was to see how fast, accurate and easy it would be to take measurements. I knew that a laser scanner would be useful, but we did not think we could afford to spend 20 million yen for a device like this. It was almost by luck that we discovered the affordable Focus3D.”
