Working as a visual effects artist
• The job: Visual-effects artist

The nature of the work: Visual-effects artists and supervisors create special effects, animation and do visual clean-up for feature films and commercials. One day, you may be supervising a shot of film extras so they can be digitally duplicated into a scene. Other days are spent in front of a computer, creating an entire alternate universe—like that used in "Avatar."
• The pay: Earnings vary, depending on whether you are employed by a company, a studio or as a free-lancer. Typically, short-term commercial jobs pay more, but television-show and film jobs provide more job security. Junior visual-effects supervisors earn an average of $2,500 a week, according to Jeffrey A. Okun, chairman of the Visual Effects Society; top-of-the-line supervisors can command tens of thousands of dollars a week.

• The hours: Workdays are usually at least 10 hours long. Deadlines are high-pressure and rarely flexible. Many artists say they work through the night to deliver a project on time. Visual-effects artists bemoan that there is no union representation to regulate hours and working conditions.

• The benefits: Artists and supervisors employed by post-production companies are usually on the payroll and receive health care and retirement benefits. Free-lancers can receive insurance via the Visual Effects Society, an industry association.

• Other incentives: Because of the late-night work required, meals are often billed to clients. Travel is also a regular part of the job. And in some cases, artists can see movies before they are released to the public.

• Best part of the job: Working alongside on-set industry luminaries, as well as the occasional actor, is exciting, says Eric Alba, a free-lance visual-effect artist who has worked on science fiction TV shows, including "Star Trek: The Next Generation." "On the best days, I get to blow up cars on set," Mr. Alba says. For those interested in office aesthetics, post-production houses also often have snazzy offices complete with videogame consoles, and desks laden with action figures, Mr. Alba says.

Worst part of the job: Dealing with clients can be arduous, particularly for advertising customers who only have a conceptual idea of what they want, says Chris Wells, a visual-effects supervisor with Hydraulx, a firm in Santa Monica, Calif. "You have to dig into a client and ask a lot of abstract questions to really get the palette and the mood they want," Mr. Wells says. "There can be a lot of trial and error." Willingness to relocate is crucial, as the lion's share of jobs are available in just a handful of cities such as Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Vancouver, British Columbia, and San Francisco. The long hours also can wreak havoc on personal relationships, Mr. Alba says. "I've called this job the widow-maker."
• Education/Qualifications: Animation and visual-effects programs are offered at a number of universities, but a degree or certificate isn't required. More important is an eye for artistic detail, such as light, shadow and texture, says Mark Tobin, managing director of The Moving Picture Co.'s Los Angeles office. "You can teach the technical knowledge, but you can't teach a great eye," Mr. Tobin says. "The key is getting your foot in the door."

Newcomers usually enter the industry through internships and apprenticeships—sometimes unpaid. Expertise in software such as Autodesk Maya and Adobe Photoshop helps. A strong reel (a short video showing clips) is critical. Since it's a tight-knit industry, networking is also key.

• Hiring: Employment in the industry is cyclical and tied to film studio budgets and appetites for films with extensive special effects. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment for artists and related workers is expected to increase 12% through 2018—on pace with other occupations.
