Our 3D CGI programme has been training students and preparing them for industry for more than a decade. We offer two main pathways: Modelling & Animation and Architectural Visualisation. Whichever pathway you enrol on the first year is generic to provide a solid base of 3D skills. Architectural Visualisation is intended for students who wish to make photorealistic visualisations of buildings, game environments and virtual set extensions for films. It includes architectural modelling techniques from CAD, texturing, lighting, rendering and post-production for stills and movies. This is a popular pathway and visualisation graduates are highly sought by industry. Our assessment is almost all coursework based and we operate in a studio environment with small groups of typically 12-15 students. Art is taught throughout to encourage creativity and visual communication. There is an individual project element to every year which helps students build a good portfolio for future interviews. We offer excellent facilities with 5 hi-spec computer suites and have cutting edge resources including an inertial motion capture suit, hand-held 3D scanner and 400-core render farm – all of which are incorporated in our coursework and available to students for use in projects.
Our CGI programme prepares students well for industry with experience of deadlines and a strong work ethic and our graduates work in over 100 different companies including many of the big games, visual effects and visualisation houses such as Codemasters, Double Negative, MPC and Visualhouse. With a Foundation Degree in Architectural Visualisation and a good portfolio, graduates will typically find junior positions in the huge number of small / medium sized visualisation companies in the UK and abroad. However your progression opportunities are increased by continuing with our BSc top-up programme which is one year with an optional placement year in industry. Many students who take placements are invited back on a permanent basis after graduating from the BSc top-up.
