CGI Has inspired a new era of film making
I come at the topic of computer-generated imagery in film from an uncommon perspective: that of an actor. My movies have grossed over $4 billion at the box office, putting me in the ranks of George Clooney and Daniel Craig.

Yet you've likely never heard of me. This is because the majority of the characters I've played have been achieved via C.G.I., or what I refer to as digital hair, makeup and wardrobe. C.G.I. characters like Woody and Buzz, Shrek and Donkey, Sulley and Mike, and Nemo and Dory have left indelible impressions on all of us. But this is just one way in which C.G.I. has made “magic” onscreen.
My area of specialty happens to be one of the newest and most unique of the C.G.I. technologies: performance capture. In movies like “The Lord of the Rings,” “Avatar,” and “Pirates of the Caribbean,” hundreds of unique and fascinating characters have been created thanks to the brilliant synergy of performer and animator. The actor drives the character, providing its voice, emotions, physical movements, facial expressions and, dare I say, soul. The animator provides all the externals of the character and connects the digital dots to make the performance fluid, seamless and lifelike. Both are integral to and inseparable from the creative process.

C.G.I., in the hands of master filmmakers and wizardly animators, opens up worlds of possibility that previously existed only in our imaginations. And much like great acting, it does so without ever drawing attention to itself. For filmmakers, writers or producers, it allows them to achieve feats of storytelling previously unattainable. For actors, it allows them to explore and inhabit the souls of characters, human or otherwise, previously inaccessible.
I've played dozens of characters within a single film. I've played men and women of all shapes, sizes and ethnicities: aliens, monsters, elves and demons, ranging in age from 6 to 6,000. Because of C.G.I., I've worked in exotic locations as disparate as the North Pole, the Amazon, the Pandoran moon and the mead halls of Herot without ever leaving Los Angeles.

In my opinion, C.G.I. has ushered in a new era of filmmaking without restrictions, acting without boundaries and storytelling without limitations.
