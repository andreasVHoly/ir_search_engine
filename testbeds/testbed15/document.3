Next Gen: Have video games finally reached CGI quality?
The next generation of gaming is upon us and with it, it brings yet another substantial leap in visuals, physics, scale and hopefully, artificial intelligence. Sony’s PS4 reveal showcased several games and the vast majority of them exhibited unprecedented visual fidelity . The quality of graphics featured in CGI-animated movies have always been held up as the holy grail for gaming visuals to aspire to but the question remains; have video games finally reached the graphical quality once only associated with CGI?
Final Fantasy Spirits Within is a good point of reference for this topic because of its association with the famous gaming franchise. The visual quality holds up surprisingly well even after 13 years since it debuted in cinemas. So how do video games hold up to this, after so long?
Pitting an old man vs an old man? That’s how we do it on Gameondaily and interestingly, the picture on the right is from Square Enix’s much talked about Luminious engine supposedly running in real time.
Whilst we won’t go through the unenviable task of comparing liver spots on these characters, it does seem, at a cursory glance, that both efoorts are equally matched as far as the static images are concerned. From what we have seen Final Fantasy: Agni’s Philosophy in motion, the way the facial animations operate in motion are quite realistic and even surpass the Spirits Within’s sometimes, awkward body movements.
Beowulf is a far more recent CGI-animated movie, and naturally, the quality of the CGI is superior to the one featured in Final Fantasy Spirits Within. So how will our games fare against it visually?
Capcom’s new I.P, Deep Down boasts some of the most detailed visuals we have ever seen in a video game courtesy of the new Phanta Rhei engine. The facial animations, the shadows and lighting and intricate details of the fire and geography are astounding.
Whilst it may not have featured a partially nude animation of Angelina Jolie, we were still left breathless after witnessing what the Phanta Rhei engine was capable of. The facial details on the characters seemed very life-like and dare we say it, even superior to Beowulf’s facial details….with the exception of Angelina Jolie. You could draw her on MS Paint and we’d still give her the win.
Synonymous with CGI-animated movies is the seminal Toy Story 3. The visuals on show are some of the best in the industry and game developers have been aspiring to reach the standard set by Pixar for a long time. It is safe to say that, if video games can replicate the fluidity of the animations and attention to detail then video games have really reached a visual milestone. At this early stage in the next-generation nothing appears to match this benchmark yet but that is only because of how little we have seen of it. However, we see no reason why games at the latter part of the next-gen cannot match or even surpass the quality set by Pixar.
Sony, rather surprisingly, began their PS4 showcase with Knack. Whilst it may not exactly be on par visually with Pixar’s efforts, or any of the games shown at the reveal, it does offer an insight into what may be in store for us in the future. Many a time, factors such as physics go hand in hand with the visuals on display; CGI animations on a character, for instance, may look particularly impressive because of the manner in which the on-screen character’s hair flows realistically. For video games to truly match up with their CGI-animated counterparts, they do not only have to ensure that the ‘raw’ visual quality is on par but also factors such as physics are spot-on.
Remember that CGI quality isn’t static either; the quality is improving just as dramatically, if not faster than video game visuals. Movies like Avatar are a testament that fact and it appears that it will be a long time until gaming replicates the quality in the latter title, but for the most part, video game graphics have moved forward a long way indeed. As of right now, it is too early to tell simply because we haven’t enough of what the next-generation is truly capable of but early signs are very promising. One can only imagine what developers will be able to achieve once they grow accustomed to the power available to them.
