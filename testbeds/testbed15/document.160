Last week the powerful voice of the ad industry Sir Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, the world’s most successful advertising company, made an announcement that was welcomed widely across the industry. 

The company reported unexpectedly good end of year financial results, a signal to industry that we may have weathered the worst of the recession and that after battening down the hatches for the past two years it’s now time for agencies to invest in growth.

As agencies shake off the repercussions of recession, there is the incumbent pressure to rebuild quickly and increase profits, and in tandem with this will always be the need to invest in the latest technology.

It has been reported that within WPP new media currently accounts for 27 per cent of revenues, but that WPP will increase this to at least a third within four years. (Source: City AM, March 8, 2010)

With the high costs of an average advertising campaign it is clear that companies will remain cautious for sometime when signing off marketing budgets.  The growth of digital marketing is both an advantage and a hindrance.

New technologies such as advances in CGI can dramatically cut the cost of creating ad campaigns.  The advantages mean a reduction in the costs involved of shooting on location, saving companies thousands on overheads.

But the average online experience and expectations from many clients are now vastly higher, meaning that companies need to ensure that they are up to date with the latest technology.

3D has become a craze in the UK and overseas with the mainstream success of movies such as Avatar and Alice in Wonderland, and the trend is set to continue for consumers with the introduction of 3D televisions.

News that Samsung are teaming up with Dreamworks to produce exclusive 3D versions of movies for home television demonstrates that organisations are recognising and seizing this opportunity. 

However the use of CGI technology in marketing has had less cut through and is perhaps not as much on the radar of some marketers in the UK as in the US.  The availability of Computer Generated Imagery offers a smart alternative for marketers who are focussing on the cost benefits of various marketing solutions.

CGI, the application of computer graphics for special effects, can be used as much for adverts, tv and printed materials as it can for movies, enabling the development of computer generated effects, and replicas of products or humans that are nearly indistinguishable from real life.

The momentum CGI has gained in the US is looking set to continue in the UK now as marketers and brands understand its use and validity within the marketing life cycle.

CG assets are created using CAD data before a product is put into the initial stages of production, and can be used for almost any industry whether it’s virtual cars, crisps, celebrities or houses.

While the flexibility of CGI technology enables the models to be transferred across print, broadcast and online marketing campaigns, it is the interactive nature of the product that gives it that elusive edge.

CG assets can turn a casual interest in a product into sales and make a serious difference to a company’s bottom line, allowing companies to create virtual customisers so that consumers can engage with their products before production has even begun. 

The beauty of CGI technology is its flexibility.  While it can hold its own as a standalone marketing technique or product, it can also be used in conjunction with the more traditional methods to achieve even higher cut through in a crowded marketplace. CG models can be seamlessly inserted into an existing campaign.

As budgets are being scrutinised more closely than ever, the cost benefits of CGI become significant; as once a digital model is created it is a multi-platform asset that can be easily used and modified without having to foot massive production bills.

This lifecycle also helps avoid commonplace minor differences or inaccuracies that can typically apply across the different mediums in a marketing campaign.

CGI is exciting and reassuring.  Simultaneously it satisfies the desire for organisations and agencies to be avant-garde in their approach, whilst reassuringly smart in their cash flow management.
