While I don’t have the problem with CGI that some people do, there are days (and movies) that have me wishing filmmakers would just cut back on it. That said, there are other movies that use it in a truly legitimate way. Smaller movies like Mirrormask are able to bring wild dreams to the screen on a tight budget, and bigger movies like The Dark Knight mix CGI with practical effects to evoke a subtly heightened reality.

And then there are people who put CGI right smack in the middle of the shot and we never notice it. Or I don’t. Well, I do, but only after I have it pointed out to me by a director commentary or something. MOVING ON.

Here are five examples of CGI that totally fooled me. Spoilers ahead. Not obscure ones, but still.

The rat from The Departed

Yeah, okay, this is a minor thing. But I never would have guessed that they couldn’t get a real rat to just run across a porch railing like that. I’m sure there’s a perfectly logical reason why that thing had to be put in later with a computer, but I haven’t done enough digging to find out. But anyway, it looks real to me.

Doc Ock sinks in Spider-man 2

I guess it would have been a little much to ask Alfred Molina to drown himself, just for the sake of a superhero movie. It’s a good thing the wizards behind the computers were up to the challenge. It’s impressive to pull off a ton of nutty action scenes, but slow, dramatic ones present their own challenges. Just look at that shot — how many synthesized extreme closeups do we get that actually work? The only other attempts that spring to mind are in The Matrix Revolutions, and those don’t even come close to Ock’s departure.

C3PO’s plating in Attack of the Clones

I literally just found out about this about a month ago, and it’s what initially sparked the idea for this post. Apparently the original version of Attack of the Clones included a scene in which C3PO was finally given his outer coverings, but it got nixed in the editing process. Unfortunately, Lucas had already shot the bits with a skeletal C3PO in them (I would assume that it’s primarily the first couple of Tatooine scenes). So he got the guys at ILM to simply put a digital C3PO over the original footage, and bam. Fooled me for almost ten years.

Zodiac

It’s gotta be hard to shoot a convincing period piece. Nothing we use today – cars, streets, lampposts – looks exactly like it did thirty years ago. Most moviemakers will rent out some old cars, dress up a couple buildings, maybe drop in an artificial background, and call it a day. Most moviemakers aren’t David Fincher. His repsonse to the challenge of making a historically accurate movie set in 1970s San Francisco was to basically rebuild the whole damn city in a computer. You wouldn’t think a quiet police thriller like Zodiac could be called a visual effects extravaganza, but once you watch them break down the effects that went into it there’s almost no other way to put it.

Spidey dodges bats in Spider-man

And we’re back to Spider-man, this time from the first movie. The shot in question is the super slow-mo shot where we see Spidey dodging a series of the Goblin’s razor bats. Obviously the bats are CG, but I still have trouble coming to terms with the fact that Spider-man is, too. I’m not entirely sure why it was necessary to do it this way. My best guess is that moves like the 360-degree flip he does at the beginning of that shot were too precise to be pulled off by a stuntman. Whatever the reason, I’m pretty sure I saw this movie five times before I found that out, and I still almost don’t believe it.

Any great ones that I missed? Obviously, the theme of the post leaves the possibility wide open. List your favorites in the comments.
