In 3D assisted simulation and test environments it is often required to interactively navigate in highly complex 3D scenes, which are partly generated at run time. To render such 3D scenes in real time, we develop rendering algorithms, which reduce the amount of data to be processed in such a way that fluent navigation is possible.

On-the-fly approximation of emerging virtual worlds

Nowadays, the specific testing of functions of driver assistance systems takes place with the aid of driving simulators which contain modern complex virtual reality representations of numerous different test scenarios. The 3D scenes of the test scenarios are highly complex, highly dynamic, and have to be rendered in real time. We develop algorithms and methods to simplify and reduce the complexity of the 3D data to be processed, to make such virtual worlds navigable. In traditional applications, these partly very large datasets are stored on physical storage media and can be preprocessed to create data structures to make this task easier. Unfortunately, such preprocessing steps are not possible in our application field, the simulation of driver assistance systems, because the virtual environment around an observer might not be completely known beforehand. For example, this is the case, when the 3D-data is generated at run time through a test leader, or received from an external data source. We develop data structures and algorithms to simplify and render complex geometry on-the-fly, without preprocessing. Future works will also focus on realistic lighting simulation for the generated scenes, using global illumination information.

Real-time rendering of CAD-data using PADrend

Since 2007, we develop in our group the rendering system PADrend (Platform for Algorithm Development and Rendering). PADrend is a software system for virtual walk-throughs in highly complex virtual 3D scenes and is aimed at the aided development of rendering algorithms and the possibility to fairly compare different algorithms. Last year, we developed new rendering algorithms in PADrend, to speed up the visualisation of highly complex CAD data. The algorithms that were developed last year focus especially on the requirements of machinery which have a high degree of moving parts in the virtual scene. In the leading-edge cluster “it's OWL”, we used PADrend to visualise highly complex CAD construction data in design reviews for mechanical engineering companies from Ostwestfalen-Lippe. The mechanical engineering company WP Kemper GmbH used PADrend at their exhibition stand at the iba in Munich for the 3D visualisation of their highly complex dynamic machinery. For this project, we also developed an algorithm for the automatic detection of animation paths for the material transport with conveyor chains, rails, or conveyor belts, using only the surface information of the 3D polygonal models.
