Since the 1990s, the use of CGI, or computer generated imagery, has exploded in both animated and live-action films. There's a constant debate between film critics and fans about whether it's better to film using a green screen and later superimpose a CGI background or to film on a real set. In the final analysis, CGI has both pros and cons.

Advantages of CGI

First, CGI enables filmmakers to create fantastic effects that would cost too much to produce physically, and the process takes less physical space. CGI, when used to create film sets, allows directors to express artistic visions that would have otherwise been impossible or prohibitively expensive. An example is James Cameron's 2009 film "Avatar." The rich jungle life of the planet Pandora, by definition, doesn't match anything on Earth, and it would have been easy for an effects team to physically make something that would have looked unbelievable, detracting from the impact of the film.

Depending on a film's genre and desired tone, the use of CGI can help or hinder. If a director wants a film's environment to feel bright and shiny, CGI can get the job done. It's easy to create objects or people that look perfect with CGI, but not as easy to create a realistic landscape that is dingy or run-down environment.

CGI can also allow for spectacle, such as the massive spaceship battles in the "Star Wars" films, the dinosaurs in "Jurassic Park" or the giant robots fighting in "Transformers." Before CGI, the film industry had to rely on stop-motion, puppetry and various practical effects, such as matte finishes, painted backgrounds and fabricated sets.

Disadvantages of CGI

For all its advantages, CGI can be a hindrance, especially when used to create humanoid characters. For example, an effect called the Uncanny Valley notes an audience's acceptance of a robot or another creature as it approaches human-like appearance and behavior. If it's obviously not human, the audience can be endeared. If it's too close to human but just a little off, there is a negative reaction that puts people off the film. It is very difficult to make a truly realistic human figure using CGI, especially with exacting details such as hair.

Another problem with CGI is that it requires actors to act against a green screen rather than against a visible backdrop. Actors frequently use the existence of the set to help get themselves into a character role ,and trying to act against a green screen makes it difficult to get into character. Also, glitches in CGI can be noticeable and can ruin immersion when played on the big screen. For example, improper character animation can lead to clipping issues where one part of a body goes through another and reminds the viewer they're simply looking at computer-generated images.

Overuse of computer-generated imagery often leads to an audience feeling that the film lacks authenticity. For example, a common complaint levelled against the "Star Wars" prequel trilogy was that Lucas's overuse of CGI caused him to neglect other aspects of the films to the detriment of the series. The acting, dialogue and story are frequently criticized, as are the abundance of CGI aliens. Over-reliance on CGI can also lead to sloppy production. Saying, "We'll just fix it later in editing," can lead to lazy filmmaking and plotting, and it allocates a greater workload to the CGI artists. If a movie has an abundance of CGI effects and is on a tight schedule, the filmmaking team can feel pressured and make mistakes. Inserting computer effects is often better used to enhance existing footage. If a film involves zombies, a normal makeup team might create some of the zombies using actors, while CGI could be used to insert additional zombies with grievous injuries to the scene to ramp up the intensity. Filming the same scene totally in CGI would likely lessen the dramatic and visual impact.

Like anything else in filmmaking, CGI is a tool. It can be a valuable asset when used properly. However, improper use or over-reliance on it can hurt the finished product far more than it helps. Knowing when to use CGI greatly increases the visual effect of a film on the intended audience. No matter how far image-editing capabilities advance, the human element of film cannot be replaced. This includes filming on location, using physical effects and giving actors something to act against. After all, a story is far stronger when it incorporate as many elements of truth as possible.
