I found a very insightful article in the September 2006 issue of ‘Media Magazine’. It discussed the ideas of developing Computer generated imagery in films becoming the USP of films, and that producers are caring less about plots and more about visual effects. It also brings up points about Computer generated creatures like Gollum (The Lord of the Rings) and how the realism of some CGI characters are improving. “It’s the filmmakers responsibility for those two hours at least to make us fear and believe they are real.” And when will CGI develop so much that audiences have to question what is real and what’s not. “CGI is rightly associated with big budget Hollywood, due to its big budget needs. However, as the craft becomes more advanced, it becomes cheaper and therefore more accessible.” This quote explores the idea of CGI being fought over by film companies, and how different companies try to rival eachother with the best, most realistic and advanced visual effects for their new films.  I found this source very useful in finding out more about Computer generated imagery as a business and art, and some films mentioned like ‘The Lord of the Rings’, and ‘King Kong’ are possible films I could look at also.
