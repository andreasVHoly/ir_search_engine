Young people don’t have tribes any more. We have smartphones instead

Once there were mods, rockers, punks and skinheads. Now, online possibilities are infinite and we can curate our own individual worlds

 Save for later
We hunt in packs. It’s human nature. We do it to protect ourselves from the threat of attack, loneliness and to gather food. And while we are at it, our packs develop their own cultures, beliefs and ways of behaving. That includes ways to amuse ourselves when not much is happening. Thankfully, we don’t have to go out and kill yaks any more, but while the technology has moved on from the wheel to the microchip, our mentality has not.

We are still tribal; the old are still trying to control the young, and the young are still trying to break free from the mortal enemies of parents, poverty and boredom. The tensions are the same as ever. But now they are being worked out in a digital world and not the real one – a world where physical strength, or even physical presence, is no longer needed.


How Margate's skinheads, mods and rockers grew up

I guess, to some extent, generational rebellion is a bit of a luxury. In most periods of history, there hasn’t been the scope for it. But in the 1950s the teds must have had enough money to afford leather (or at least fake leather) jackets when they got together to rebel. And the mods and rockers in the 1960s must have had the time and money to meet up and wreck a few coffee shops, and blag a few scooters and parkas for bank holiday nonsense.

The skinheads had violence, racism, misogyny and football – a reminder that not all teenage fads or tribes are worth our nostalgia.

Punk came and went, shocking and spitting, but at least it killed the 20-minute drum solo of the 1970s. Anyone could be a punk; all you needed was a safety pin, an attitude, and a desire to shock – going along for the ride before gravity sucked you back into real life.

The new romantics of the 1980s were weird but interesting with all that gender stuff. Too many drugs though. And Britpop in the 1990s was cool. Great music and you had a choice – Blur or Oasis. Oasis for the boozy working-class. Blur for the arty middle-class. They evoked the same feelings but with different haircuts.

So what of my lot, the millennial generation? Where are our youth tribes? I suppose, in many ways, my generation is a bit like all the others. Kids sitting bored brainless in a council flat, or some useless suburb, or some provincial town miles from anywhere. The angry energy tearing us up has always found its release in creativity.

But now we have a different cure for that angry boredom. And it’s in our pocket. Did Steve Jobs create the cure? With a touch of a button, or a swipe of the screen, we are free. Totally, crazily free, and in a universe of our own making.

We now live in a world where we can listen to every note of music ever recorded, talk to a close circle of like-minded friends across the globe, and find any fact about anything we are interested in, within a couple of seconds.

And rather than being tribal, everyone is an individual now. The smartphones at the ends of our arms are attached through our fingers to our nervous systems, where they tap straight into our brain cells. Through our phones we create customised, alluring worlds. There’s no parental control, no guidance and nothing to stop us doing whatever we want, when we want.

My mum and sister brought me up in a little house outside Swansea city centre, and when I was 13 all I wanted to be was the world’s greatest guitarist. My guitar hero was John Frusciante, of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. I had no interest in school, girls, football or anything. My mind had a mind of its own.

But I was lucky. I could go home, and, for free in my own little bedroom, I could watch YouTube videos of Frusciante teaching fans how to play his songs – I was over 8,000 miles and eight time zones away from my greatest teacher.

I did this endlessly. It was better than anything else I could have possibly done. I was more excited than anyone else could possibly be. My love affair with the internet had begun.

That lasted until I was about 17 or 18 and realised I had no language to talk about my feelings and fears with anyone in the real world. I wasn’t able to talk properly about being a quiet lad, being a feminist, being a vegetarian, and secretly wanting to change the world. So I lost myself further in poems, books and music.

When my school friends went off to university I moved to London and started a band. The idea was that our flat would be a 24/7 creative work space, like Andy Warhol’s Factory, where no internet was allowed, and artists would come and share ideas and everything would be real and face-to-face.

But my refusal to embrace the internet hindered our progress. Our first single was played on the radio but no one had any way of creating an online community around us. Soon enough I had to revert back to my 13-year-old self and fuse with fibre optics.

Now, through my phone, I have access to infinite inspiration from all over the world. We all do. I am liberated from the here and now and can’t remember when I was last bored. When I want to be with the people I am with, I just switch it off. Other than that, as in love and music, there are no rules.

Of course there are dangers. Smartphone bullying is real. Young people are under pressure and feel judged on social media all the time. It can turn your brain to popcorn.

But while the pre-teens go to One Direction, and those who are 35 and over go to see bands who had one hit decades ago and are now touring at £50 a ticket, those of us in the middle are left blasting away in our fragmented world of endless choice.

People are right about my generation being doomed. By the time we get old, the safety net will be threadbare. So we switch off and switch on our devices, and disappear into a virtual world where everything is possible.
