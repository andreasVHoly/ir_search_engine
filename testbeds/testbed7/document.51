Android M finally gets a name: Android Marshmallow

Mmmmm, the sweet flavor of a new mobile operating system

Google's Android operating system has always been a walk down a candy store aisle: Lollipop, Kit Kat, and Jelly Bean, all the way down to Cupcake. Now, the previously codenamed "Android M" has been revealed: Android Marshmallow.

While also a key ingredient to a s'more, the new operating system touts improved control of which apps can see user data, automated backup of settings, and support for the new USB Type-C port. There's a revamp to Android Pay, which the company introduced earlier this year. Fingerprint recognition will finally also be unified across the OSâ€”right now companies are engineering fingerprint software themselves, and it's caused security issues.

The announcement was teased earlier today, when Google software engineer posted a picture on Google+ of what seemed to be a covered Android Statue.

And at Google's HQ in Mountain View, the old operating systems seem excited for another treat to join their lineup.

Android Marshmallow will likely be available this fall.
