Samsung just made the latest addition to its 14nm chipset family official - the Exynos 7 Octa 7870. We already saw a preview of the silicon yesterday, so the announcement doesn't really come as a surprise. In essence, the offer seems to be intended as an expansion of the company's coveted 14 nanometer FinFET process to the mid-range realm.

Inside the new Exynos 7 Octa 7870, we find a total of eight Cortex-A53 cores, clocked at up to 1.7Ghz, along with a Mali-T830 GPU. This is actually airily reminiscent of the Exynos 7 Octa 7580, which uses the same arrangement of cores, but is built on a much less efficient 28nm process.

Similarities between the pair extend even further to the Cat.6 LTE modem and LPDDR3 support. This further proves the mid-range nature of the Exynos 7870, which is intended to take on a number of other similar offers from the likes of Qualcomm and MediaTek as well.


Other specs on the Octa 7870 include ISP support for up to two 16MP shooters or 8MP ones in dual camera mode. Display support goes up to WUXGA (1920Ã—1200 pixels) and video playback tops at 1080p at 60fps. GNSS is also integrated on-board with fast time-to-first-fix (TTFF) feature.

Overall, the Exynos 7 Octa 7870 promises 30% less power consumption than comparable offers, built on a 28nm process, while preserving the same performance level. Mass production of the chip is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2016.
