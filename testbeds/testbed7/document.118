Report says Galaxy S7/S7 edge pre-orders in China set to cross 10 million mark 

Himanshu, 16 March, 2016 Samsung Android Rumors
Just a week after Samsung's mobile chief Koh Dong-jin said that they are expecting their newest flagships - the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge - will help reverse the firm's fortunes in China, there is some good news for the South Korean tech giant.


According to a new report, pre-orders for the flagships in China are set to cross the the 10 million milestone, and the figure could even hit the 15 million mark by the time the pre-order window closes, something which will happen on March 18.

Keep in mind, however, that pre-orders in China are usually unlike pre-orders elsewhere - it's more of a 'register your interest,' which means that actual sales numbers can be quite different. We'll have to wait for Samsung to confirm these numbers if this is actually the case.

In case you missed it, China - which is the world's largest smartphone market - is one of the few countries where the new Galaxy phones do not have the front Samsung logo, although it's difficult to say whether this has anything to do with the devices' performance in the country.

The report comes just a few days after Samsung revealed that the total number of Galaxy S7/S7 edge pre-orders it received in Europe was over 2.5 times more than what it received for previous Galaxy phones in the region.
