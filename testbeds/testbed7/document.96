Android Marshmallow doubles its market share in a month

Vlad, 05 April, 2016 Google Android State of Android
The latest release of Google's mobile operating system has managed to double its market share within the last month. Marshmallow is now installed on 4.6% of all Android devices out there, whereas back in March it was sitting at 2.3%. That's some pretty convincing growth, even if it does come from a low number obviously.

In April, Lollipop has grabbed 35.8% of the market, which interestingly is 0.3% less than last month - so perhaps some of Marshmallow's gains have been made at the expense of Lollipop. Moving on, KitKat now has 33.4% market share, down 0.9% from March.


The three Jelly Bean releases taken together now account for 21.3% of the Android pie, one percentage point less than before. The very slow death of Ice Cream Sandwich continues with another 0.1% market share drop, while Gingerbread and Froyo have somehow managed to stay at 2.6% and 0.1%, respectively.

As you'd expect, any versions with less than 0.1% distribution aren't shown in the chart above. What we see here then are some nice gains for Marshmallow, while every other version (except for the Gingerbread and Froyo outliers) has lost market share. That's probably indicative of what you should expect for the near future too.
