Google’s parent company Alphabet saw its revenue grow 17% during the first three months of this year, the company said on Thursday, but spent more money on its experimental moonshot projects, engineers, data centers and YouTube shows, causing it to miss investors’ profit expectations.
Alphabet shares dropped more than 4% in the US during after-hours trading to about $724 a share.
The dilemma illustrates Alphabet’s key challenge as it seeks to become the technology firm most omnipresent in consumers lives, including search, email, smartphones, maps, self-driving cars, virtual reality and even cancer research.
Alphabet’s growth has also attracted attention from regulators. On 20 April, the European Union’s antitrust regulators charged the company with using its mobile operating system, Android, to block out competitors.
The company is growing dramatically, but ruling such a vast empire isn’t cheap. Alphabet in the past year has worked to cut costs – even spending less on its famous staff meals – but spending in some categories has gone up.
Alphabet lost $802m on what it called its “other bets” during the first quarter of 2016, compared to $633m a year earlier. The loss comes in spite of revenue from those units more than doubling, from $80m to $166m, during the first quarter. Other bets include things such as Nest, the smart thermostat company; Google Fiber, the company’s high-speed internet; and self-driving cars.
Google operating expenses also increased, hitting $7.3bn compared to $6.5bn during the same stretch last year.
The company took in $20.3bn during the first quarter, up from $17.3bn a year earlier. The vast majority of that money came from Google ad sales, which brought Alphabet about $18bn compared to $15.5bn last year.
Ruth Porat, Alphabet’s chief financial officer, said much of the spending growth was from building data centers, YouTube content and hiring more engineers.
Talking to investors as the results were announced, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the company plans to launch a total of 15-20 original series on YouTube this year, part of an effort to woo millennials away from TV screens. Asked by an analyst if the company would also license existing programs, Pichai said the company is considering all options.
The CEO also said that some of Google’s work on experimental technologies is actually quite practical.
Take artificial intelligence (AI). The Google-owned AI project Deepmind recently defeated a grandmaster in the ancient Korean game of Go. Pichai said that one day he does hope it can be used on “even bigger challenges like climate change and cancer diagnosis”.
In the meantime, he said Google will use such technology putting more brains in calendar and photo apps.
“We continue to focus on expenses we can actually control,” Porat said on a conference call for investors. She added Google faces a “required investment in our ecosystem”.
Alphabet arguably can afford to keep spending money because it’s making a lot of it. The company took in $20.3bn during the first quarter, up from $17.3bn a year earlier.
