Galaxy S7 is smashing pre-order records

ADNAN F. / 2 MONTHS AGO

Samsung appears to have a winner on its hands with the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 edge. The new flagships are a great evolutionary upgrade to the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 edge and fans greatly appreciate the return of features like water resistance and the microSD slot both of which were missing last year. Consumer interest appears to be high for the new flagship smartphones.

Pre-orders for the Galaxy S7 are smashing records previously established by Samsung’s flagship lineup. According to a report out of Russia, this is more or less the case in all 60 launch markets and that includes Russia. 64 percent of pre-orders placed in Russia have been for the Galaxy S7 edge and remaining for the Galaxy S7, this isn’t surprising since the Galaxy S6 edge proved to be more popular than its non-curved counterpart last year and was the winner in our recent poll as well.

Pre-orders for the new flagships went live on February 23 and Samsung has declared March 11 as the official launch date. If you’re on T-Mobile in the United States there’s a very good chance that your pre-order will arrive before everybody else gets their hands on the new handsets.
