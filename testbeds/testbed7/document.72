GSMArena giveaway: Enter to win an HTC 10, get discount codes on cases 

Ricky, 30 April, 2016 Giveaway Spigen HTC Samsung Android Accessories
The HTC hype has been real lately, so we bring you our latest giveaway where you can enter for a chance to win an HTC 10, courtesy of our friends over at Spigen. They will also toss in a case bundle for the lucky winner!

The HTC 10 has been getting a lot of hype lately. HTC did a great job of building it up with its later-than-usual release and months of teasing prior to that. The HTC 10 really is a compelling little phone which definitely stands up with the other competitors.


The HTC 10 unit will be provided by Spigen and will be fulfilled once it becomes available in retail stores.
