George, 24 March, 2016 Apple iOS
As promised on announcement day, Apple is now accepting pre-orders for the brand new 4-inch iPhone SE and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Pre-ordered devices will be delivered on March 31, when you will also be able to find them in physical stores.


The iPhone SE marks Apple's return to 4-inch displays, which some users still insist is the best size for a smartphone. The SE is also the cheapest iPhone ever, with a base price of $399/€489/£359 for the 16GB version, and $100/€100/£80 more for 64GB of storage.


The iPad Pro 9.7, which replaces the iPad Air 2, starts at $599/€689/£499 for the Wi-Fi only 32GB variant, and cellular connectivity will set you back an additional $130/€150/£100. 128GB and 256GB storage options are available too, and the top-end 256GB cellular model goes up to $1029/€1199/£839. You can also order a Smart Keyboard for $149/€169/£129, and in the States it'll even arrive before the actual tablet - 1 to 3 business days.
