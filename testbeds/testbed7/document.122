State of Android: Marshmallow and Lollipop keep growing market share 

Vlad, 08 March, 2016 Google Android State of Android
Last month Android 6.0 Marshmallow finally broke past the 1% mark in Google's market share report. It doubled its spread since December, but now its growth is finally picking up. In fact, at the beginning of March Android 6.0 was on 2.3% of devices out there, so it's grown by more than 100% in one month or so. Hopefully this means it will get its market share into the double digits soon.

Lollipop has finally become the most used version of the OS, taking KitKat's place with 36.1% of the market compared to 34.3%. While Lollipop has grown 2% from the previous report, KitKat has lost 1.2% of the pie. And it's bound to go down even more.


Jelly bean now has 22.3% market share, Ice Cream Sandwich is down to 2.3%, while Gingerbread is at 2.6% and Froyo's still holding on to 0.1% of the market.

In the coming months more and more devices should be graced with updates to Marshmallow, so that version will obviously keep on growing. So too should Lollipop, while every other Android release is basically on the way out now - if incredibly slowly.
