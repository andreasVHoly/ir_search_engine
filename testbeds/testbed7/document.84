March has been quite a successful month for Oppo. The company boasts it has taken the first spot in offline sales in China thanks to the soaring interest for the F1 Plus (R9 in China). The data is gathered by independent research company Sino MR.


The analysis shows that the company sold 180,000 units on the first day of sales (March 24). Just four days later, the number of Oppo R9 phones sold was topping 400,000.

Following Oppo in terms of sales volume for March is Vivo and Apple with 12.1% and 11.2%, respectively. Huawei is fourth with 9.4%, but its sub-brand Honor is also doing well with a 4.5% market share, so combined it actually holds the lead.

The Oppo R9 is powered by a Mediatek Helio P10 chipset with four of its Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 2.0GHz, the other four at 1.0GHz. 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage are on board and the R9 can take up to 128GB of microSD cards in the hybrid microSD/second-SIM slot.

The Oppo R9 is priced at CNY 2,799 in China ($430).
