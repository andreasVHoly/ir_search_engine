Microsoft's sales numbers might suggest that its Windows 10 Mobile platform is taking its last breaths, but the Redmond, Washington-based company seems to be in no mood to retreat.

In an email sent out to several company executives and partners, the executive vice president of Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group Terry Myerson has made it clear that the company is committed to the OS platform and is also working on new mobile devices.


Here's an excerpt from the email:

I understand that you are hearing concerns from certain partners about Microsoft's commitment to the mobile space.

Let me be very clear: We are committed to deliver Windows 10 on mobile devices with small screen running ARM processors.

We are currently in development of our next generation products and I wanted to reconfirm our commitment to Windows 10 Mobile. We believe in this product's value to business customers and it is our intention to support the Windows 10 Mobile platform for many years. We have a device roadmap to support that from Microsoft as well as our OEM partners who will also be selling an expanded lineup of phone devices based on this platform.

Microsoft has been long-rumored to be working on a device dubbed Surface Phone. In fact, the company has dropped several hints in the past effectively confirming a Surface branded phone is indeed in the making, with CMO Chris Capossella even calling it a "breakthrough device."
