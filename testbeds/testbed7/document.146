BBC News is creating a controller of mobile and online in the first stage of division director James Harding’s cost-cutting Future of News plans.

In a presentation to staff on Tuesday, the former editor of the Times revealed how he plans to “organise BBC News, mobile and online” under its new controller, who will sit on the BBC’s News Group board.

In January, Harding began looking into reshaping the division as it “can’t afford to do everything” in the face of around £80m of cuts it plans to make by 2021-22.

Harding said further updates would be rolled out slowly, with the next set of plans revealed in a fortnight when “we’re going to discuss leadership and priorities”, with details of where cuts will fall expected in July.

Harding said the staggering of announcements was partly due to needing more detail and for more work to be done, but also “because we don’t want our strategy to be interpreted – or misinterpreted – in the context of the government’s work on the forthcoming white paper; [also] if we’re setting out how we’re going to make savings in news, we want to do that in context of savings across the whole of the BBC.”



He told staff that at an executive board meeting last month he requested that his Future of News plans be considered in two stages.

“At the second stage, in July, we are due to go back with more details on options and offer costed recommendations for decision.”

With the new structure Harding hopes there will be more focus on mobile: “If we want to reach younger people, people on lower incomes, women and black, Asian, minority ethnic communities under-served by the BBC, then we are going to have to do more to use new technologies to do so. Chief among them, mobile.”

Staff were also given an update on the BBC’s streaming news service Newstream, which has had an internal launch of ‘Ten to Watch’, an on-demand bulletin within the BBC News app which some BBC News employees are testing.
