Apple called out for copyright infringement with 3D Touch

When you're as big as Apple, you get used to staffing a strong legal department pretty quick. Copyright claims and lawsuits have become such a mundane part of the tech business that we honestly can't even remember a time when Cupertino and Samsung weren't at each other's throats over some legal claim. Plus, suing a gigantic corporation is often a viable way to earn a few bucks and many have even turned it into a questionable, but still quite profitable business model.


Still, there is always the honest case of being mistreated as a little player on the market and asking for some justice, which is precisely what Immersion out of California claims to be doing with its recent lawsuit against Apple and its Force Touch and 3D Touch technology.

The claim revolves around three patents awarded to Immersion. The first is titled "Haptic feedback system with stored effects " and seems to describe software that shows previews after a light press and actions after a firm one. That does sound quite familiar to Apple's "Peek and Pop", but we definitely won't pass judgment.


The second and third patents are “Method and Apparatus for Providing Tactile Sensations” and "Interactivity Model for Shared Feedback on Mobile Devices", which Immersion ties to Apple's haptic feedback on touch. But that sounds like a bit more vague of a claim.

Currently Immersion is pursuing legal actions against Apple seeking reparations for damages, but has also filed a complaint with the International Trade Commission (ITC), requesting a sales injunction on the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus within the US, which sounds like the more troubling bit.
