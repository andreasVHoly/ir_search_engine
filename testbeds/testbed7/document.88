A key feature of the Huawei P9 and P9 Plus is their dual-camera setup, co-engineered with Leica. Recent information regarding the two cameras reveal they are made by Sunny Optical Technology of China, which is a camera manufacturer authorized by Leica.


This is the first time the Germany-based Leica is cooperating with a Chinese OEM. If this first endeavor proves successful, it's quite possible to see more Leica camera tech in future smartphones.

Here is an official statement from Huawei:

The P9 and P9 Plus were co-engineered between Huawei and Leica. This is the first collaboration between the two companies following a long-term partnership that was announced in February. From the very beginning, Leica has been deeply involved in the development of these devices. There has been significant technological collaboration between Huawei and Leica around many aspects of the camera, including optical design, imaging quality, image data processing, optimization, and the mechanical construction of the camera module to the graphic user interface. The devices meet Leica's highest imaging quality standards.
In our Huawei P9 review we concluded that the phone has one of the best camera setups on the market. The dynamic range is high and colors are spot on with more than enough resolved detail.
