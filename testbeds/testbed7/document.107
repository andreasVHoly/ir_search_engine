New Oppo F1 Plus teaser hints at fingerprint reader 

Victor, 29 March, 2016 Oppo Android Rumors
An upgraded Plus version of the Oppo F1 has been teased for a long time now. Ever since the Mumbai launch of the original handset, the manufacturer has been giving us glimpses of the upgraded model, said to come some time in April. As far as we currently know, the F1 Plus will be almost identical to its sibling in terms of design, only bigger with a suggested 5.5-inch, 1080p display.


However, a new official teaser now suggests that there will probably be at least one new exterior detail on the new model - a fingerprint reader. The image in question talks of "PLUS SECURITY" and references the F1 Plus with a hash tag "#OPPOF1Plus". Last, but not least, the "Coming soon" post, accompanying the shot is a clear indication that the device is on its way to Indonesia.


As for the rest of the specs on the Oppo F1 Plus, rumors suggest 4GB of RAM, instead of 3GB. An improved selfie camera experience has also been hinted at.

There is also a suggested price of INR 26,990 or around $395 circulating in the rumor mill, which is quite a big of a markup from the INR 15,990 (around $235) the F1 is going for.
