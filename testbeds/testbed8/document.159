Case 6: S is black, S's right child is red, and N is the left child of its parent P. In this case we rotate left at P, so that Sbecomes the parent of P and S's right child. We then exchange the colors of P and S, and make S's right child black. The subtree still has the same color at its root, so Properties 4 (Both children of every red node are black) and 5 (All paths from any given node to its leaf nodes contain the same number of black nodes) are not violated. However, N now has one additional black ancestor: either P has become black, or it was black and S was added as a black grandparent. Thus, the paths passing through N pass through one additional black node.
Meanwhile, if a path does not go through N, then there are two possibilities:
1.	It goes through N's new sibling SL, a node with arbitrary color and the root of the subtree labeled 3 (s. diagram). Then, it must go through S and P, both formerly and currently, as they have only exchanged colors and places. Thus the path contains the same number of black nodes.
2.	It goes through N's new uncle, S's right child. Then, it formerly went through S, S's parent, and S's right child SR (which was red), but now only goes through S, which has assumed the color of its former parent, and S's right child, which has changed from red to black (assuming S's color: black). The net effect is that this path goes through the same number of black nodes.
Either way, the number of black nodes on these paths does not change. Thus, we have restored Properties 4 (Both children of every red node are black) and 5 (All paths from any given node to its leaf nodes contain the same number of black nodes). The white node in the diagram can be either red or black, but must refer to the same color both before and after the transformation.
