A rope is a binary tree having leaf nodes that contain a short string. Each node has a weight value equal to the length of its string plus the sum of all leaf nodes' weight in its leftsubtree, namely the weight of a node is the total string length in its left subtree for a non-leaf node, or the string length of itself for a leaf node. Thus a node with two children divides the whole string into two parts: the left subtree stores the first part of the string. The right subtree stores the second part and its weight is the sum of the left child's weight and the length of its contained string.
The binary tree can be seen as several levels of nodes. The bottom level contains all the nodes that contain a string. Higher levels have fewer and fewer nodes. The top level consists of a single "root" node. The rope is built by putting the nodes with short strings in the bottom level, then attaching a random half of the nodes to parent nodes in the next level.
Operations[edit]
In the following definitions, N is the length of the rope.
Index[edit]
 
Figure 2.1: Example of index lookup on a rope.
Definition: Index(i): return the character at position i
Time complexity: O(log N)
To retrieve the i-th character, we begin a recursive search from the root node:
 // Note: Assumes 1-based indexing.
 function index(RopeNode node, integer i)
     if node.weight < i then
         return index(node.right, i - node.weight)
     else
         if exists(node.left) then
             return index(node.left, i)
         else
             return node.string[i]
         end
     end
 end
