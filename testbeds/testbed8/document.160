Proof of asymptotic bounds[edit]
A red black tree which contains n internal nodes has a height of O(log n).
Definitions:
•	h(v) = height of subtree rooted at node v
•	bh(v) = the number of black nodes (not counting v if it is black) from v to any leaf in the subtree (called the black-height).
Lemma: A subtree rooted at node v has at least   internal nodes.
Proof of Lemma (by induction height):
Basis: h(v) = 0
If v has a height of zero then it must be null, therefore bh(v) = 0. So:
 
Inductive Step: v such that h(v) = k, has at least   internal nodes implies that   such that h( ) = k+1 has at least   internal nodes.
Since   has h( ) > 0 it is an internal node. As such it has two children each of which have a black-height of either bh( ) or bh( )-1 (depending on whether the child is red or black, respectively). By the inductive hypothesis each child has at least   internal nodes, so   has at least:
 
internal nodes.
Using this lemma we can now show that the height of the tree is logarithmic. Since at least half of the nodes on any path from the root to a leaf are black (property 4 of a red–black tree), the black-height of the root is at least h(root)/2. By the lemma we get:
 
Therefore, the height of the root is O(log n).
