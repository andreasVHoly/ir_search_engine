Non local search[edit]
User can define Choose  operation which for a root (nonleaf) cluster selects one of its child clusters. The top tree blackbox provides Search  routine, which organizesChoose queries and reorganization of the top tree (using the Internal operations) such that it locates the only edge in intersection of all selected clusters. Sometimes the search should be limited to a path. There is a variant of nonlocal search for such purposes. If there are two external boundary vertices in the root cluster  , the edge is searched only on the path  . It is sufficient to do following modification: If only one of root cluster children is path cluster, it is selected by default without calling the Choose operation.
Examples of non local search[edit]
Finding i-th edge on longer path from   to   could be done by  =Expose({v,w}) followed by Search( ) with appropriate Choose. To implement the Choose we use global variable representing   and global variable representing   Choose selects the cluster   with   iff length of   is at least  . To support the operation the length must be maintained in the  .
Similar task could be formulated for graph with edges with nonunit lengths. In that case the distance could address an edge or a vertex between two edges. We could define Choose such that the edge leading to the vertex is returned in the latter case. There could be defined update increasing all edge lengths along a path by a constant. In such scenario these updates are done in constant time just in root cluster. Clean is required to distribute the delayed update to the children. The Clean should be called before theSearch is invoked. To maintain length in   would in that case require to maintain unitlength in   as well.
Finding center of tree containing vertex   could be done by finding either bicenter edge or edge with center as one endpoint. The edge could be found by  =Expose({v})followed by Search( ) with appropriate Choose. The choose selects between children     with   the child with higher maxdistance . To support the operation the maximal distance in the cluster subtree from a boundary vertex should be maintained in the  . That requires maintenance of the cluster path length as well.
