An associative array (also called dictionary or map) is a more flexible variation on an array, in which name-value pairs can be added and deleted freely. A hash table is a common implementation of an associative array.
A record (also called tuple or struct) is an aggregate data structure. A record is a value that contains other values, typically in fixed number and sequence and typically indexed by names. The elements of records are usually called fields or members.
A union is a data structure that specifies which of a number of permitted primitive types may be stored in its instances, e.g. float or long integer. Contrast with a record, which could be defined to contain a float and an integer; whereas in a union, there is only one value at a time. Enough space is allocated to contain the widest member datatype.
A tagged union (also called variant, variant record, discriminated union, or disjoint union) contains an additional field indicating its current type, for enhanced type safety.
A set is an abstract data structure that can store specific values, in no particular order and with no duplicate values.
A graph and a tree are linked abstract data structures composed of nodes. Each node contains a value and one or more pointers to other nodes arranged in a hierarchy. Graphs can be used to represent networks, while variants of trees can be used for sorting and searching, having their nodes arranged in some relative order based on their values.
A class is a data structure that contains data fields, like a record, as well as various methods which operate on the contents of the record. In the context of object-oriented programming, records are known as plain old data structures to distinguish them from classes
