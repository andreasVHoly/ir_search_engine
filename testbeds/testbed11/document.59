The caGrid computer network and software supported the cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG) initiative of the National Cancer Institute of the US National Institutes of Health.
caBIG is a voluntary virtual informatics infrastructure that connects data, research tools, scientists, and organizations.
In 2013, the National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP) re-released caGrid under the BSD 3-Clause license, and migrated the source repository to github.


== Globus toolkit ==
caGrid uses version 4.03 of the Globus Toolkit, produced by the Globus Alliance.


== Portal ==
The caGrid Portal was a Web-based application built on Liferay that enables users to discover and interact with the services that are available on the caGrid infrastructure. Portal serves as the primary visualization tool for the caGrid middleware. It also served as a caBIG information source. Through the caGrid Portal, users had access to information about caBIG participants, caGrid points of contact (POCs), and caGrid-related news and events.


== Workflow ==
caGrid workflow uses:
Active BPEL
Taverna


== Contributors ==
Ohio State University
University of Chicago, Argonne National Laboratory
SemanticBits, LLC
Ekagra Software Technologies


== Criticism ==
In March 2011, the NCI published an extensive review of CaBIG, the NCI CBIIT program that funded the caGrid software development (see [1], [2]), which included a long list of problems with the program, and recommended that most of the software development projects should be discontinued.
