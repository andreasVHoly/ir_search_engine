Dan Boneh (/boʊˈneɪ/; Hebrew: דן בונה‎) is a researcher in applied cryptography and computer security. He is a Professor of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. He teaches three massive open online courses on the online learning platform Coursera, namely Computer Security, Cryptography I and Cryptography II.
Born in Israel in 1969, Boneh obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Princeton University in 1996 under the supervision of Richard J. Lipton.


== Research ==
Boneh is one of the principal contributors to the development of pairing-based cryptography from the Weil Pairing, along with Dr. Matt Franklin of the University of California at Davis.


=== Cryptography ===
Some of Boneh's results in cryptography include:
2015 Privacy-preserving proofs of solvency for Bitcoin exchanges
2010 He was involved in designing tcpcrypt, TCP extensions for transport-level security
2005 The first broadcast encryption system with full collusion resistance (with Craig Gentry and Brent Waters)
2003 A timing attack on OpenSSL (with David Brumley)
2001 An efficient identity-based encryption system (with Matt Franklin) based on the Weil pairing.
1999 Cryptanalysis of RSA when the private key is less than N0.292 (with Glenn Durfee)
1997 Fault-based cryptanalysis of public-key systems (with Richard J. Lipton and Richard DeMillo)
1995 Collusion resistant fingerprinting codes for digital data (with James Shaw)
1995 Cryptanalysis using a DNA computer (with Christopher Dunworth and Richard J. Lipton)


=== Computer security ===
Some of his contributions in computer security include:
2007 "Show[ing] that the time web sites take to respond to HTTP requests can leak private information."
2005 PwdHash a browser extension that transparently produces a different password for each site


== Awards ==
Boneh has received a number of awards, including the following:
The Packard Award
Sloan Research Fellowship
the Terman Award
2005 RSA Award
Gödel Prize, 2013, with Matthew K. Franklin and Antoine Joux, for his work on the Boneh–Franklin scheme
ACM-Infosys Foundation Award in Computer Sciences, 2014
