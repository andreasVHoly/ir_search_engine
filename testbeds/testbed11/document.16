GreenButton was a New Zealand-based software firm specializing in cloud computing. The company specializes in the creation of cloud platforms for the improvement and dispatch of software and services, which helps Independent software vendors (ISVs) and enterprises to move to the cloud.

== History ==
GreenButton was founded as InterGrid in 2006 in Wellington, New Zealand, to provide small scale customers with a seamless interface to access job processors. GreenButton's hybrid approach helps software vendors use cloud computing. The company had a total turnover of $1.5 million for the fiscal year 2011-12.
In June 2012, GreenButton announced a partnership with the GNS Science of New Zealand and American based Stillwater Group for the optimization of cloud computing during complex seismic processing. The company is currently developing a software solution called "Cloud Claritas", which integrates heavy seismic processing to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform. Seismic processing is an integral part of the Oil and natural gas exploration process, and requires heavy processing of data.
On 2 May 2014, GreenButton announced its acquisition by Microsoft. While the company will retain its New Zealand-based staff, GreenButton's technology will be directly integrated into Microsoft Azure. As a result of the acquisition, GreenButton immediately stopped accepting new customers on the same day.
