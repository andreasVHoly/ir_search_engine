The European Conference on Wireless Sensor Networks (EWSN) is an annual academic conference on wireless sensor networks.
Although there is no official ranking of academic conferences on wireless sensor networks, EWSN is widely regarded as the top European event in sensor networks.

== History ==
EWSN started in year 2004 and the prime motivation behind EWSN was to provide the European researchers working in sensor networks a venue to disseminate their research results. However, over the years EWSN has grown into a truly International event with participants and authors coming from all over the world. In 2006 it was decided to silently upgrade the event from a workshop to a conference. With this change in effect the acronym (i.e. EWSN) remains the same. Therefore, when giving a reference to EWSN 2004 to 2006 use European Workshop on Wireless Sensor Networks, and when giving a reference to EWSN 2007 onwards use European Conference on Wireless Sensor Networks.
