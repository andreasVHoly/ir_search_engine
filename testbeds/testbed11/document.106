xMax developed by xG Technology, Inc. is a cognitive radio based mobile VoIP and computer networking system operating in the license-free ISM 900 MHz band (902-928 MHz). xMax is built upon an end-to-end Internet Protocol (IP) system infrastructure that includes a line of base stations, mobile switching centers (MSC), handsets and modems.


== Performance claims ==
A press report was published in 2005 quoting inventor Joseph Bobier. The technology was said to compete with WiMax, but details were initially not disclosed. By 2006, the company announced it had "completed" the technology after six years of development. In 2009, a blogger wrote that he witnessed a xMax mobile VoIP pilot network operated by the company in Fort Lauderdale: "xMax worked well and is real. When you realize that this company may have found a way to take a frequency riddled with wireless garbage and turn it into a fully functioning wireless voice and data network you start to see how much of a game changer this could be for the wireless industry."
