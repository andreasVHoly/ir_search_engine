Part Two, Advanced Topics, contains information the more complex aspects of Python, such as GUI programming. Other topics covered include regular expressions, network programming, multithreaded programming, web programming and database programming. 


== Critical response ==
Core Python Programming has been generally well received by reviewers. Jeremy Turner, from www.freesoftwaremagazine.com, rated Core Python Programming 10 out of 10, stating:
"You should buy this book because it is the best reference guide and learning material on the Python programming language. The book is easy to follow and is an excellent place to start or brush up on your Python skills."
On the other hand, he also stated that:
"Python pros, or those looking for answers and examples to specific problems may not enjoy this book. The book is also not a complete reference of the Python language, but does do a very good job of explaining it." Michael Baxter, in a review of the first edition of Core Python Programming on Linux Journal, was also very positive about the book.
