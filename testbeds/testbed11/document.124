TVU networks distributed TVUBroadcast software which allowed users to broadcast content off "mms://" servers, and from computer disks. TVU provided a downloadable application through early 2013. The TVUbroadcaster however, would not let users stream video files. Instead, an encoder was required.

=== TVUPack ===
TVUPack family of portable transmission solutions enables broadcasters to deliver video of live news and events to audiences from any location. TVUPack broadcasts live video in HD or SD using multiple 3G/4G/LTE/Wi-Fi/WiMAX/BGAN connections. TVUPack products use TVU Networks' proprietary Inverse StatMux+ technology. Inverse StatMux+ dynamically segments a live video signal and transmits the segments through multiple independent connections, and then uses intelligent monitoring and control to adjust the signal in real-time to ensure that each 3G/4G/LTE wireless connection is fully utilized.


=== TVU Grid ===
TVU Grid is an IP-video distribution, routing and switching system that gives broadcasters the ability to switch between live IP video content and share live video streams between multiple remote locations.


=== TVUPlayer ===
TVUPlayer was freeware software application for Windows and Mac OS X to watch several dozen TV channels over the Internet. TVU did not broadcast these channels, but provided a platform for broadcasters to distribute content online. It was the responsibility of the individual who broadcasts a particular channel on TVU to keep the channel running and ensure that the content can be legally transmitted. It was unknown to the viewer who the broadcaster was. Broadcasts originate from either a large broadcasting company itself, which chose to provide viewers with its broadcast, or individual broadcasters who created their own content or capture public broadcasts and rebroadcast them on TVU.
It was debated whether TVU Networks operated an illegal service by knowingly providing users with an opportunity to watch copyrighted content without the permission of content owners. However, the company did not provide the illegal content itself due the fact that was the responsibility of the user who provided the content to verify its legality.
TVU Networks shut down service to the TVUPlayer on February 25, 2013.
