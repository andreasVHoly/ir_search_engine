== Notable installations ==
In 2006, Firetide announced that they were going to supply their technology to Singapore's Wireless@SG project. The project's goal was to install a nationwide network to enable public Wi-Fi as well as video and voice traffic.
In 2007, Firetide installed its technology on the construction site of Burj Khalifa (Burj Dubai). The construction workers had experienced problems with their communication equipment as the tower grew taller. Firetide could provide a wireless mesh network that VoIP radios could use, which allowed coverage where Walkie-Talkies could not.
In 2009, Firetide got the assignment to install a wireless mesh network in Seoul Metropolitan Subway. The request from the South Korean subway operator for live camera coverage came after a fatal arson in 2003. Compared to its competitors, Firetide was the only one that could deliver reliable wireless connection to the station and the moving trains. The systems included cameras on the train stations and on the trains. The design aimed to avoid more fatal accidents by distributing real-time video feed both to the train drivers and to the operators in the command central. The installation included 1000 mesh nodes as well as 650 cameras.
January 2009, Firetide installed a system at California State University, Long Beach.


== Partnership ==
In May 2010, Firetide announced an Original Equipment Manufacturer OEM agreement with Netgear. The license agreement enabled for Netgear to use Firetide's WLAN Controller software in their new portfolio of WLAN controllers. 


== Acquisition ==
Firetide, Inc., announced it has been acquired by UNICOM Systems, Inc., a Division of UNICOM Global, on May 19, 2014. Details of the acquisition were not disclosed.
