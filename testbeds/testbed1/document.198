Bryan Vore of  opened his review by stating the "biggest surprises" found in ''Armored Core 4'' are the multiplatform status of the title and the "next-gen graphical makeover".  However, he felt that mech customization was still as inaccessible as it had been previously ("do we really need to worry about four separate booster classes?"), and that the online gameplay was disappointing.Vore, Bryan and Ben Reeves.  Armored Core 4 Review - "Core Mech Values".  Game Informer, April 2007 Issue. Robert Workman of  felt that the faster pace of gameplay in missions was disappointing, commenting that battles that took "thirty to forty-five minutes in a previous Armored Core" now takes "just five to ten minutes".  He also considered the multiplayer to be disappointing, with the maps being "too simple in design".  His overall feeling was that it was "too user-friendly" and would be a turn-off to longtime fans.March 26, 2007.  Workman, Robert.  .  Gamedaily.com.  Retrieved April 17, 2010.
