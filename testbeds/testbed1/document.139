 navies suffered a disastrous defeat at the hand of the , on 27 February 1942, and in secondary actions over successive days. The  (ABDACOM) Strike Force commanderRear-Admiral was killed. The aftermath of the battle included several smaller actions around Java, including the smaller but also significant . These defeats led to Japanese occupation of the entire .
At the time, the battle was the largest surface ship engagement since the  in 1916.
==Background==
The Japanese invasion of the  progressed at a rapid pace as they advanced from their  colony and captured bases in  and the southern Philippines. They seized bases in eastern  and in northern  while troop convoys, screened by s and s with air support provided by swarms of fighters operating from captured bases, steamed southward through the  and into the . To oppose these invading forces was a small force, consisting of Dutch, American, British & Australian warshipsmany of them of  vintageinitially under the command of Admiral .
On 23 January 1942, a force of four American destroyers attacked a Japanese invasion convoy in Makassar Strait as it approached  in Borneo. On 13 February, the Allies fought unsuccessfullyin the to prevent the Japanese from capturing the major oil port in eastern . On the night of 19/20 February, an Allied force attacked the Eastern Invasion Force off  in the . Also on the 19th, the Japanese made two , on the Australia mainland, one from carrier based planes and the other by land based planes. The destruction of Darwin rendered it useless as a supply and naval base to support operations in the East Indies.
Shortly before the battle commenced, the odds were not good for the Allied forces. They lacked cohesion (ships came from four separate navies) and were demoralized by constant air attacks and a general sentiment that the Japanese were unbeatable. In addition, the coordination between Allied navies and air forces was poor.
==Battle==
The Japanese  gathered to strike at Java, and on 27 February 1942, the main  (ABDACOM) naval force, under Doorman, sailed northeast from  to intercept a convoy of the Eastern Invasion Force approaching from the Makassar Strait. The  Eastern Strike Force, as it was known,BBC.  consisted of two s ( and ), three s (Doorman's flagship , , ), and nine destroyers (, , , , , , , , and ).
The Japanese task force protecting the convoy, commanded by Rear-Admiral , consisted of two heavy ( and ) and two light cruisers ( and ) and 14 destroyers (, , , , , , , , , , , , , and ) including the 4th Destroyer Squadron under the command of Rear Admiral . The Japanese heavy cruisers were much more powerful, armed with ten  guns each and superb es. By comparison, ''Exeter'' was armed only with six  guns. While ''Houston'' carried nine  guns, only six remained operable after her aft turret had been knocked out in an earlier air attack.
The ABDA force engaged the Japanese in the Java Sea, and the battle raged intermittently from mid-afternoon to midnight as the Allies tried to reach and attack the troop transports of the Java invasion fleet, but they were repulsed by superior firepower. The Allies had local air superiority during the daylight hours, because Japanese air power could not reach the fleet in the bad weather. The weather also hindered communications, making cooperation between the many Allied parties involvedin reconnaissance, air cover and fleet headquarterseven worse than it already was. The Japanese also jammed the radio frequencies. ''Exeter'' was the only ship in the battle equipped with , an emerging technology at the time.
The battle consisted of a series of attempts over a seven-hour period by Doorman's Combined Striking Force to reach and attack the invasion convoy; each was rebuffed by the escort force with heavy losses being inflicted on the Allies.
The fleets sighted each other at about 16:00 on 27 February and closed to firing range, opening fire at 16:16. Both sides exhibited poor gunnery and torpedo skills during this phase of the battle. Despite her recent refit (with the addition of modern Type 284 gunnery control radar), ''Exeter''s gun-fire did not come close to the Japanese ships, while ''Houston'' only managed to achieve a straddle on one of the opposing cruisers.  The only notable result of the initial gunnery exchange was ''Exeter'' being critically damaged by a hit in the boiler room from an  shell. The ship then limped away to Surabaya, escorted by ''Witte de With''.
The Japanese launched two huge torpedo salvoes, 92 in all, but scored only one hit, on ''Kortenaer''. She was struck by a , broke in two and sank rapidly after the hit.
''Electra''covering ''Exeter''engaged in a duel with ''Jints'' and ''Asagumo'', scoring several hits but suffering severe damage to her superstructure. After a serious fire started on ''Electra'' and her remaining turret ran out of ammunition, abandon ship was ordered. On the Japanese side, only ''Asagumo'' was forced to retire because of damage.
The Allied fleet broke off and turned away around 18:00, covered by a smoke screen laid by the four destroyers of U.S Destroyer Division 58 (DesDiv&nbsp;58). They also launched a torpedo attack but at too long a range to be effective. Doorman's force turned south toward the Java coast, then west and north as night fell in an attempt to evade the Japanese escort group and fall on the convoy. It was at this point the ships of DesDiv&nbsp;58their torpedoes expendedleft on their own initiative to return to Surabaya.
Shortly after, at 21:25, ''Jupiter'' ran onto a mine and was sunk, while about 20 minutes later, the fleet passed where ''Kortenaer'' had sunk earlier, and ''Encounter'' was detached to pick up survivors.
Doorman's command, now reduced to four cruisers, again encountered the Japanese escort group at 23:00; both columns exchanged fire in the darkness at long range, until ''De Ruyter'' and ''Java'' were sunk, by one devastating torpedo salvo. Doorman and most of his crew went down with ''De Ruyter''; only 111 were saved from both ships.
Only the cruisers ''Perth'' and ''Houston'' remained; low on fuel and ammunition, and following Doorman's last instructions, the two ships retired, arriving at  on 28 February.
Although the Allied fleet did not reach the invasion fleet, the battle did give the defenders of Java a one-day respite.
==Aftermath==
===Battle of Sunda Strait===
''Perth'' and ''Houston'' were at Tanjung Priok on 28 February when they received orders to sail through  to . Material was running short in Java, and neither was able to rearm or fully refuel. Departing at 21:00 on 28 February for the Sunda Strait, by chance they encountered the main Japanese invasion fleet for West Java in . The Allied ships were engaged by at least three cruisers and several destroyers.
In a ferocious night action that ended after midnight on 1 March, ''Perth'' and ''Houston'' were sunk. A Japanese minesweeper and a troop transport were sunk by friendly fire, while three other transports were damaged and had to be beached.
===Second Java Sea===
After emergency repairs the badly-damaged ''Exeter'' left Surabaya for ; she departed at dusk on 28 February and limped toward Sunda Strait, escorted by the destroyers HMS ''Encounter'' and USS ''Pope''. However, all three ships were intercepted by the Japanese heavy cruisers ''Nachi'', ''Haguro'', ''Myk'' and ''Ashigara''  and their attendant destroyers  on the morning of 1 March. ''Exeter'' and ''Encounter'' were sunk together around noon, while ''Pope'' escaped only to be sunk several hours later by aerial attack.
===Bali Strait===
The four U.S destroyers of DesRon&nbsp;58''John D. Edwards'', ''John D. Ford'', ''Alden'' and ''Paul Jones''were also at Surabaya; they left for Australia at nightfall on 28 February. After a brief encounter with a Japanese destroyer in the , which they were able to evade, they reached  safely on 4 March.
===Consequences===
A further two American, and one Dutch destroyer were sunk as they attempted to escape to Australia. The main ABDA naval force had been almost totally destroyed: 10 ships and approximately 2,173 sailors had been lost. The Battle of the Java Sea ended significant Allied naval operations in South-East Asia in 1942, and  on 28 February. The Dutch surface fleet was practically eradicated from the Asian waters and the Netherlands would never reclaim full control of its colony. The Japanese had laid open the control of one of the most important food-producing regions, Java, and by conquering the Dutch East-Indies Japan also gained ultimate control over the sources of the fourth largest oil producer in the world in 1940.
The U.S. and  then started to retreat to Australia. Dutch troops aided by British remnants fought fiercely for a week. In the campaign the Japanese executed many Allied s and sympathizing Indonesians. Despite their logistical problems, the decisive factor in Japan's favor seems to have been air power. Eventually, the Japanese won this decisive battle of attrition and ABDA forces surrendered on 9 March.
