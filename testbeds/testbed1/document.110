Agricultural_science
'''Agricultural science''' is a broad multidisciplinary field of  that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and  that are used in the practice and understanding of . (, but not , is often excluded from the definition.)
==Agriculture, agricultural science, and agronomy==
The three terms are often confused. However, they cover different concepts:
*Agriculture is the set of activities that transform the environment for the production of animals and plants for human use. Agriculture concerns techniques, including the application of agronomic research.
* is  related to studying and improving plant-based crops.
Agricultural sciences include research and development on:
* Production techniques (e.g.,  management, recommended  inputs)
* Improving  in terms of quantity and quality (e.g., selection of -resistant crops and animals, development of new s, yield-sensing technologies, simulation models of crop growth, in-vitro  techniques)
* Minimizing the effects of pests (s, s, s, s) on crop or animal production systems.
* Transformation of primary products into end-consumer products (e.g., production, preservation, and packaging of s)
* Prevention and correction of adverse environmental effects (e.g., , , )
* , relating to crop production modeling
* Traditional agricultural systems, sometimes termed , which feed most of the poorest people in the world.  These systems are of interest as they sometimes retain a level of integration with natural ecological systems greater than that of , which may be more sustainable than some modern agricultural systems.
* Food production and demand on a global basis, with special attention paid to the major producers, such as China, India, Brazil, the USA and the EU.
* Various sciences relating to agricultural resources and the environment (e.g. soil science, agroclimatology); biology of agricultural crops and animals (e.g. crop science, animal science and their included sciences, e.g. ruminant nutrition, farm animal welfare); such fields as agricultural economics and rural sociology; various disciplines encompassed in agricultural engineering.
===Agricultural biotechnology===
 is a specific area of agricultural science involving the use of scientific tools and techniques, including , , , , and , to modify living organisms: plants, animals, and .
== Fertilizer ==
One of the most common yield reducers is because of fertilizer not being applied in slightly higher quantities during transition period, the time it takes the soil to rebuild its aggregates and organic matter.  Yields will decrease temporarily because of nitrogen being immobilized in the crop residue, which can take a few months to several years to decompose, depending on the crop's C to N ratio and the local environment
==A local science==
With the exception of , research in agronomy, more than in any other field, is strongly related to local areas. It can be considered a science of , because it is closely linked to soil properties and , which are never exactly the same from one place to another. Many people think an agricultural production system relying on local weather,  characteristics, and specific crops has to be studied locally. Others feel a need to know and understand production systems in as many areas as possible, and the human dimension of interaction with nature.
==History of agricultural science==
Agricultural science began with 's genetic work, but in modern terms might be better dated from the  outputs of  understanding in 18th-century Germany. In the United States, a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the , which used the term "agricultural science". The Hatch Act was driven by farmers' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer. The  of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built.Hillison J. (1996). . ''Journal of Agricultural Education''. After 1906, public expenditures on agricultural research in the US exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years.Huffman WE, Evenson RE. (2006). ''''. .
Intensification of agriculture since the 1960s in developed and , often referred to as the , was closely tied to progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity, as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial s and s.
As the oldest and largest human intervention in nature, the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently , industrial development, and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields. These include technological fields that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology, such as ,  technologies, , , and  fields that include references to  as something essentially different from non-essential economic 'goods'. In fact, the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science.
New technologies, such as  and  (for data processing and storage), and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields, including , , improved , and . Balancing these, as above, are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the human-nature interactions of , including interaction of , and the non-material components of agricultural production systems.

==Agricultural science and agriculture crisis==
Agriculture sciences seek to feed the world's population while preventing  problems that may affect human health and the . This requires promoting good management of  and respect for the environment, and increasingly concern for the psychological wellbeing of all concerned in the food production and consumption system.
Economic, environmental, and social aspects of agriculture sciences are subjects of ongoing debate. Recent crises (such as avian influenza,  and issues such as the use of s) illustrate the complexity and importance of this debate.
