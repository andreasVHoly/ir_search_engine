1080p
'''1080p''' (also known as  and )''' '''is a set of   modes characterized by 1080 horizontal lines of vertical  and , as opposed to , as is the case with the  display standard. The term usually assumes a   of , implying a resolution of 1920x1080 (2.1 ) often marketed as '''Full HD'''.
1080p video signals are supported by  in the United States, and  in Europe. Applications of the 1080p standard include television broadcasts,  discs, s, Internet content such as  and , consumer s and s, s, s, s and s.
==Broadcasting standards==
Any display device that advertises 1080p typically refers to the ability to accept 1080p signals in native resolution format, which means there are a true 1920 pixels in width and 1080 pixels in height, and the display is not over-scanning, under-scanning, or reinterpreting the signal to a lower resolution. The  logo program, by , requires that certified TV sets support 1080p 24 fps, 1080p 50 fps, and 1080p 60 fps formats, among other requirements, with fps meaning .
For live broadcast applications, a high-definition progressive scan format operating at 1080p at 50 or 60 frames per second is currently being evaluated as a future standard for moving picture acquisition.  has been endorsing 1080p50 as a  production format because it improves resolution and requires no , allows broadcasting of standard 1080i25 and 720p50 signal alongside 1080p50 even in the current infrastructure and is compatible with  distribution formats.
1080p50/p60 production format requires a whole new range of studio equipment including cameras, storage and editing systems, and contribution links (such as  and ) as it has doubled the data rate of current 50 or 60 fields interlaced 1920x1080 from 1.485&nbsp;Gbit/s to nominally 3&nbsp;Gbit/s using uncompressed RGB encoding. Most current revisions of ,  and EBU Tech 3299 require  color space and 4:2:2  for transmitting 1080p50 (nominally 2.08&nbsp;Gbit/s) and 1080p60 signal.
Recent studies show that for digital broadcasts compressed with H.264/AVC, transmission bandwidth savings of  over fully progressive video are minimal even when using twice the frame rate; i.e., 1080p50 signal (50 progressive frames per second) actually produces the same bit rate as 1080i50 signal (25 interlaced frames or 50 sub-fields per second).
===ATSC===
In the United States, the original  for HDTV supported 1080p video, but only at the frame rates of 23.976, 24, 25, 29.97 and 30 frames per second (colloquially known as '''1080p24''', '''1080p25''' and '''1080p30''').
In July 2008, the ATSC standards were amended to include  compression and 1080p at 50, 59.94 and 60 frames per second ('''1080p50''' and '''1080p60'''). Such s require H.264/AVC '''', while standard HDTV frame rates only require Level 4.0.
This update is not expected to result in widespread availability of 1080p60 programming, since most of the existing digital receivers in use would only be able to decode the older, less-efficient  codec, and because there is a limited amount of bandwidth for .
===DVB===
In Europe, 1080p25 signals have been supported by the  of broadcasting standards. The 1080p50 is considered to be a future-proof production format and, eventually, a future broadcasting format. 1080p50 broadcasting should require the same bandwidth as 1080i50 signal and only 1520% more than that of 720p50 signal due to increased compression efficiency, though 1080p50 production requires more bandwidth and/or more efficient s such as , high-bitrate , or  and .
From September 2009,  and , the maintainers of the DVB suite, added support for 1080p50 signal coded with MPEG-4 AVC ''High Profile Level 4.2'' with  extensions or  ''Advanced Profile'' compression; DVB also supports 1080p encoded at ATSC frame rates of 23.976, 24, 29.97, 30, 59.94 and 60.
EBU requires that legacy MPEG-4 AVC decoders should avoid crashing in the presence of SVC and/or 1080p50 (and higher resolution) packets. SVC enables  with 1080p50 and 1080p60 broadcasting for older MPEG-4 AVC receivers, so they will only recognize baseline SVC stream coded at a lower resolution or frame rate (such as 720p60 or 1080i60) and will gracefully ignore additional packets, while newer hardware will be able to decode full-resolution signal (such as 1080p60).
==Availability==
===Broadcasts===
In the United States, 1080p over-the-air broadcasts still do not exist as of May 2016; all major networks use either 720p60 or 1080i60 encoded with MPEG-2. However, satellite services (e.g., , XstreamHD and ) utilize the 1080p/24-30 format with MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 encoding for  movies that are downloaded in advance via satellite or on-demand via broadband.  At this time, ''no pay service channel'' such as USA, HDNET, etc. nor premium movie channel such as HBO, etc., stream their services live to their distributors () in this format because many MVPDs, especially DBS and cable, do not have sufficient bandwidth to provide the format streaming live to their subscribers without negatively impacting their current services.
For material that originates from a progressive scanned 24 frame/s source (such as film),  lets the video be coded as 1080p24, irrespective of the final output format. These progressively-coded frames are tagged with metadata (literally, fields of the PICTURE header) instructing a decoder how to perform a  to interlace them. While the formal output of the MPEG-2 decoding process from such stations is 1080i60, the actual content is coded as 1080p24 and can be viewed as such (using a process known as ) since no information is lost even when the broadcaster performs the 3:2 pulldown.
===Blu-ray Disc===
s are able to hold 1080p HD content, and most movies released on  produce a full 1080p HD picture when the player is connected to a 1080p  via an  cable. The Blu-ray Disc video specification allows encoding of 1080p23.976, 1080p24, 1080i50, and 1080i59.94. Generally this type of video runs at 30 to 40 megabits per second, compared to the 3.5 megabits per second for conventional standard definition broadcasts.
===Smartphones===
s with 1080p FullHD display have been available on the market since 2012. As of the end of 2014, it is the standard for mid to high end smartphones and many of the flagship devices of 2014 used even higher resolutions.
===Internet content===
Several websites, including , allow videos to be uploaded in the 1080p format. YouTube streams 1080p content at approximately 4 megabits per second compared to Blu-ray's 30 to 40 megabits per second.   services also deliver 1080p content, such as movies available on Blu-ray Disc and/or from broadcast sources. This can include distribution services like peer-to-peer websites and public or private tracking networks.
 has been offering high quality 1080p content in the US and other countries through select internet providers since 2013.
===Consumer televisions and projectors===
As of 2012, most consumer televisions being sold provide 1080p inputs, mainly via , and support full high-definition resolutions. 1080p resolution is available in all types of television, including , ,  front and rear projection and .
For displaying film-based 1080i60 signals, a scheme called 3:2 pulldown reversal () is beginning to appear in some newer 1080p displays, which can produce a true 1080p quality image from film-based 1080i60 programs. Similarly, 25fps content broadcast at 1080i50 may be deinterlaced to 1080p content with no loss of quality or resolution.
AV equipment manufacturers have adopted the term ''Full HD'' to mean a set can display all available HD resolutions up to 1080p. The term is misleading, however, because it does not guarantee the set is capable of rendering digital video at all frame rates encoded in source files with 1080 pixel vertical resolution. Most notably, a "Full HD" set is not guaranteed to support the 1080p24 format, leading to .
 (formerly EICTA) maintains the  logo program that requires the certified TV sets to support 1080p24, 1080p50, and 1080p60, without  and picture distortion.
===Computer monitors===
Most widescreen  (CRT) and  (LCD) monitors can  1080p content. For example, widescreen  monitors support 1920x1200 resolution, which can display a pixel for pixel reproduction of the 1080p (1920x1080) format. Additionally, many 23, 24, and  widescreen LCD monitors use 1920x1200 as their native resolution; 30&nbsp;inch displays can display beyond 1080p at up to 2560x1600 (). Many 27" monitors have native resolutions of 2560x1440 and hence operate at .
===Video game consoles===
Video game consoles such as 's , 's  and 's , as well as  like  ,  and  can display upscaled games and video content in 1080p, although the vast majority of games are rendered at lower resolutions. For all of the consoles, this is done through HDMI connections (in the case of the Xbox 360, HDMI is only available on consoles manufactured after June 2007). Additionally, the upscaled 1080p video is available on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 via an / () connection, as well as the VGA connection on the Xbox 360. On the PlayStation 3, developers must provide specific resolution support at the software level as there is no hardware upscaling support, whereas on the Xbox 360 games can be upscaled using a built in hardware scaler chip. However, most games on both consoles do not run at a native 1080p resolution.
The Wii U, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 provide 1080p video services. Sony provides both the   service and  playback. Microsoft provides the  for "instant on" 1080p video content but does not have Blu-ray disc playback capability. It does however support the now-defunct  disc standard via the  add-on. Both consoles also offer support for streaming 1080p content in various formats over home network from other computers, and also via USB connection to external storage devices.
 Due to potential copyright issues, when an analog component connection is used, only system menus and gameplay are available in 1080p; video content is displayed at a lower resolution or in 1080i.
 While 1080p analog component output is supported by the consoles, some display hardware will only accept component connections up to 1080i.
===Camcorders and cameras===
Many consumer s, professional video and  cameras, and s can capture 1080p24, 1080p25, or 1080p30 video, often encoding it in  format.
