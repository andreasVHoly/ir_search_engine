CER-22
(  ''Digital Electronic Computer'') model 22 was a  based  developed by  () in 1967-1968. It was originally intended for ing applications and was used for data processing and management planning in banks, trade and utility companies in Belgrade. Three CER-22 computers were purchased by Beobanka,  and BVKBelgrade companies. (For more details see: Ref.# 1, #2, #3, and #4).
The principal designers and chiefs of the project teams were:
 
*Duan Hristovi, Svetomir Ojdani, Veselin Poti, Radivoje Ili et al. for Beobanka;
*Dr Sc. Miroslav Jockovi, Branimir Leposavic, Michael Savikin, Ljubivoje Markovi et al., for Jugopetrol co.;
*Vladislav Paunovi, Milo Marjanovi, Petar Vrbavac, Dragia Tinkovi et al. for BVK-Belgrade.
