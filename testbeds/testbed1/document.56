Nvidia
'''NVIDIA Corporation''' ( ) (commonly referred to as '''Nvidia''', stylized as '''NVIDIA''', '''nVIDIA''' or '''nvidia''') is as an American  based in . Nvidia designs s (GPUs) for the gaming market, as well as  units (SOCs) for the  and automotive market. Nvidia's primary GPU product line, labeled "", is in direct competition with ' (AMD) "" products. Nvidia expanded its presence in the gaming industry with its handheld  , and .
Since 2014, Nvidia has shifted to become a platform company focused on four markets&nbsp; Gaming, Professional Visualization, Data Centers and Auto.
In addition to GPU manufacturing, Nvidia provides  capabilities to researchers and scientists that allow them to efficiently run high-performance applications. They are deployed in  sites around the world. More recently, Nvidia has moved into the  market, where it produces  mobile processors for smartphones and tablets, as well as vehicle navigation and entertainment systems. In addition to , its competitors include  and .
== Company history ==
=== Founders and initial investment ===
Three people co-founded Nvidia in 1993:
*  (CEO as of 2013), a Taiwanese-born American, previously Director of  at  and a  designer at  (AMD).
* , an electrical engineer who worked at .
* , previously a senior staff engineer and graphics chip designer at Sun Microsystems.
The founders received venture capital funding from .
=== Major releases and acquisitions ===
Autumn 1999 saw the release of the  (NV10), most notably introducing on-board  (T&L) to consumer-level 3D hardware. Running at 120&nbsp;MHz and featuring four pixel pipelines, it implemented advanced video acceleration, motion compensation, and hardware sub-picture alpha blending. The GeForce outperformed existing products by a wide margin.
Due to the success of its products, Nvidia won the contract to develop the graphics hardware for 's  game console, which earned Nvidia a $200 million advance. However, the project drew the time of many of Nvidia's best engineers away from other projects. In the short term this did not matter, and the  shipped in the summer of 2000.
In 2000, Nvidia acquired the intellectual assets of its one-time rival , one of the biggest graphics companies of the mid-to-late 1990s.
In July 2002, Nvidia acquired Exluna for an undisclosed sum. Exluna made software rendering tools and the personnel were merged into the Cg project.
In August 2003, Nvidia acquired MediaQ for approximately US$70 million.
On April 22, 2004, Nvidia acquired iReady, also a provider of high performance TCP/IP and iSCSI offload solutions.
December 2004 saw the announcement that Nvidia would assist  with the design of the graphics processor () in the  game console. In March 2006, it emerged that Nvidia would deliver  to Sony as an , and that Sony alone would organize the manufacture of the RSX. Under the agreement, Nvidia would provide ongoing support to port the RSX to Sony's fabs of choice (Sony and Toshiba), as well as s to 65&nbsp;nm. This practice contrasted with Nvidia's business arrangement with Microsoft, in which Nvidia managed production and delivery of the Xbox GPU through Nvidia's usual third-party foundry contracts. Meanwhile, in May 2005 Microsoft chose to license a design by ATI and to make its own manufacturing arrangements for the  graphics hardware, as had  for the  console (which succeeded the ATI-based )..

On December 14, 2005, Nvidia acquired , which at the time supplied third-party  parts for s to , Nvidia's competitor.
In March 2006, Nvidia acquired . Hardware news: 
In December 2006, Nvidia, along with its main rival in the graphics industry AMD (which had acquired ATI), received subpoenas from the  regarding possible  violations in the graphics card industry.
'''' magazine named Nvidia its ''Company of the Year'' for 2007, citing the accomplishments it made during the said period as well as during the previous 5 years.
On January 5, 2007, Nvidia announced that it had completed the acquisition of , Inc.Press Release: , dated January 5, 2007.
In February 2008, Nvidia acquired  Technologies for an undisclosed sum. Ageia developed the  physics engine hardware and SDK. (The press-release made no mention of the acquisition-cost nor of future plans for specific products.)
In April 2009, a court consolidated multiple class action suits into one case, titled The NVIDIA GPU Litigation. Nvidia agreed to replace faulty chips in or reimburse purchasers who already spent to get their laptop repaired. Nvidia also gave replacement laptops to many users in lieu of making a repair. The replacements and payments were not made until the settlement was finalized in 2011. Users were required to show proof of purchase and mail in their original faulty laptop. The chips were present in a number of Dell and HP laptops, as well as two Apple MacBook Pro models. Although the settlement cost Nvidia millions of dollars, many of the individuals were unhappy with the settlement, and multiple websites and blogs reflected this. The website entitled Fair Nvidia Settlement was one such site.
On January 10, 2011, Nvidia signed a six-year cross-licensing agreement with Intel, marking the end of all outstanding legal disputes between these two companies. According to the agreement, Intel agreed to pay Nvidia $1.5 billion in licensing fees in five annual installments.
On February 15, 2011, Nvidia announced and demonstrated the first quad-core processor for mobile devices at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. It was announced that the chip was expected to ship with many  to be released in the second half of 2011, and the chip, dubbed the , was released on November 9, 2011.
In May 2011, it was announced that Nvidia had agreed to acquire , a baseband chip making company in the UK, for $367 million in cash.
On July 29, 2013, Nvidia announced that they acquired  from STMicroelectronics.
On January 6, 2013, Nvidia introduced at CES 2013, the  mobile processor (codename "Wayne"), containing 72 GPU cores, a Quad-core ARM Cortex-A15 CPU core, and LTE capability among its features.
On February 19, 2013, Nvidia announced the Tegra 4i (codename "Project Grey"), its first fully integrated 4G LTE mobile processor, featuring 5 times more GPU cores than Tegra 3, 1080p HD support, and Nvidia Chimera Computational Photography Architecture.
On January 6, 2014, Nvidia introduced at CES 2014, the  mobile processor (codename "Logan"), containing 192 GPU cores and a Quad ARM Cortex-A15 MPCore R3 + low power companion core (32-bit) or Dual-core  (64-bit). As of February 2014, Nvidia claims that the Tegra K1 outperforms both the Xbox 360 and the PS3 hardware.

== Open-source software support ==
Until September 23, 2013, Nvidia had not published any documentation for its hardware, meaning that programmers could not write appropriate and effective   for Nvidia's products without resorting to () .
Instead, Nvidia provides its own  GeForce graphics drivers for  and a thin open-source library that interfaces with the ,  or  kernels and the  graphics software. Nvidia also provided but stopped supporting an obfuscated open-source driver that only supports two-dimensional hardware acceleration and ships with the  distribution.
The proprietary nature of Nvidia's drivers has generated dissatisfaction within  . Some Linux and BSD users insist on using only open-source drivers, and regard Nvidia's insistence on providing nothing more than a binary-only driver as wholly inadequate, given that competing manufacturers (like ) offer support and documentation for  developers, and that others (like ) release partial documentation and provide some active development.
 Ubuntu Gamer, January 10, 2011 (Article by Luke Benstead)
Because of the closed nature of the drivers, Nvidia video cards cannot deliver adequate features on some platforms and architectures given that Nvidia only provides x86/x64 driver builds. As a result, support for 3D graphics acceleration in Linux on  does not exist, nor does support for Linux on the -restricted  console.
Some users claim that Nvidia's Linux drivers impose artificial restrictions, like limiting the number of monitors that can be used at the same time, but the company has not commented on these accusations.
As of January 31, 2014, Nvidia's Alexandre Courbot committed an extensive patch set which add initial support for the GK20A () to nouveau.
