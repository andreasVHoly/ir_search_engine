AMBER
'''AMBER''' (an  for '''Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement''') is a family of  for  of  originally developed by 's group at the .  '''AMBER''' is also the name for the molecular dynamics software  that simulates these force fields. It is maintained by an active collaboration between David Case at , Tom Cheatham at the , Tom Darden at NIEHS, Ken Merz at Michigan State University,  at , Ray Luo at , and Junmei Wang at Encysive Pharmaceuticals.
== Force field ==
The term "AMBER " generally refers to the functional form used by the family of AMBER force fields. This form includes a number of parameters; each member of the family of AMBER force fields provides values for these parameters and has its own name.
=== Functional form ===
The functional form of the AMBER force field is
:
V(r^N)=\sum_\text k_b (l-l_0)^2 + \sum_\text k_a (\theta - \theta_0)^2
+ \sum_\text \sum_n \frac V_n  
+\sum_ ^ \sum_ ^N f_\biggl\
Note that despite the term force field, this equation defines the potential energy of the system; the force is the derivative of this potential with respect to position.
The meanings of right hand side  are:
* First term ( over bonds): represents the energy between covalently bonded atoms. This harmonic (ideal spring) force is a good approximation near the equilibrium bond length, but becomes increasingly poor as atoms separate.
* Second term (summing over angles): represents the energy due to the geometry of electron orbitals involved in covalent bonding.
* Third term (summing over torsions): represents the energy for twisting a bond due to bond order (e.g. double bonds) and neighboring bonds or lone pairs of electrons. Note that a single bond may have more than one of these terms, such that the total torsional energy is expressed as a .
* Fourth term (double summation over i and j): represents the non-bonded energy between all atom pairs, which can be decomposed into  (first term of summation) and  (second term of summation) energies.
The form of the van der Waals energy is calculated using the equilibrium distance ( r_ ) and well depth ( \epsilon ). The factor of 2 ensures that the equilibrium distance is  r_ . The energy is sometimes reformulated in terms of \sigma, where  r_ = 2^(\sigma), as used e.g. in the implementation of the softcore potentials.
The form of the electrostatic energy used here assumes that the charges due to the protons and electrons in an atom can be represented by a single point charge (or in the case of parameter sets that employ lone pairs, a small number of point charges.)
=== Parameter sets ===
To use the AMBER force field, it is necessary to have values for the parameters of the force field (e.g. force constants, equilibrium bond lengths and angles, charges). A fairly large number of these parameter sets exist, and are described in detail in the AMBER software user manual. Each parameter set has a name, and provides parameters for certain types of molecules.
*Peptide, protein, and nucleic acid parameters are provided by parameter sets with names beginning with "ff" and containing a two digit year number, for instance "ff99".
*GAFF (General AMBER force field) provides parameters for small organic molecules to facilitate simulations of drugs and small molecule ligands in conjunction with biomolecules.
*The GLYCAM force fields have been developed by Rob Woods for simulating carbohydrates.
== Software ==
The AMBER software suite provides a set of programs for applying the AMBER forcefields to simulations of biomolecules. It is written in  and  with support for most major  systems and . Development is conducted by a loose association of mostly academic labs. New versions are generally released in the spring of even numbered years; AMBER 10 was released in April 2008. The software is available under a site-license agreement, which includes full source, currently priced at US$500 for non-commercial and US$20,000 for commercial organizations.
=== Programs ===
* '''LEaP''' is used for preparing input files for the simulation programs
* '''Antechamber''' automates the process of parameterizing small organic molecules using GAFF
* '''SANDER''' (Simulated Annealing with NMR-Derived Energy Restraints) is the central simulation program and provides facilities for energy minimization and molecular dynamics with a wide variety of options
* '''pmemd''' is a somewhat more feature-limited reimplementation of sander by Bob Duke. It was designed with parallel processing in mind and has significantly better performance than sander when running on more than 8&ndash;16 processors
** '''pmemd.cuda''' has been made in order to run simulations on GPU enabled machines
** '''pmemd.amoeba '''was developed to handle the extra parameters in the polarizable AMOEBA force field.
* '''nmode''' calculates normal modes
* '''ptraj''' provides facilities for numerical analysis of simulation results. AMBER does not include visualization capabilities; visualization is commonly performed with . Ptraj is now unsupported as of AmberTools 13. 
* '''cpptraj '''is a rewritten version of ptraj made in C++ to provide faster analysis of simulation results. Several actions have been made parallelizable with OpenMP and MPI 
* '''MM-PBSA''' allows for implicit solvent calculations on snap shots from molecular dynamics simulations
* '''NAB''' is a built in nucleic acid building environment made to aid in the process of manipulating proteins and nucleic acids where an atomic level of description will help with computation.
