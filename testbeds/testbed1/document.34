== Uses ==
Some common types of applications that use Velocity are:
* s: s create  pages with placeholders for dynamic information. The page is processed with ''VelocityViewServlet'' or any of a number of frameworks which support Velocity.
*  generation: Velocity can be used to generate Java source code, , or , based on . A number of  and commercial development  use Velocity in this manner.
* Automatic s: Many applications generate automatic emails for account signup,  reminders, or automatically sent reports. Using Velocity, the email  can be stored in a , rather than directly embedded in Java code.
*  transformation: Velocity provides an  task, called Anakia, which reads an XML file and makes it available to a Velocity template. A common application is to convert  stored in a generic "xdoc" format into a styled HTML document.
== Code example ==
The following :
## Velocity Hello World
    
       #set( $foo = "Velocity" )
       ## followed by
       Hello $foo World!
    
processed by Velocity will produce the following HTML:
    
     Hello Velocity World!
    
The syntax and overall concept of the Apache Velocity templates is very similar to the syntax of the older  template engine which is now also an open source project.
