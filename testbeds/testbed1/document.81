2000_United_States_Census
The '''Twenty-second ''', known as '''Census 2000''' and conducted by the , determined the resident population of the  on April 1, 2000, to be 281,421,906, an increase of 13.2% over the 248,709,873 people enumerated during the . This was the twenty-second federal census and was at the time the largest civilly administered peacetime effort in the United States.
Approximately 16 percent of households received a "long form" of the 2000 census, which contained over 100 questions. Full documentation on the 2000 census, including census forms and a procedural history, is available from  the .

==Population profile==
The U.S. resident population includes the total number of people in the 50 states and the . The Bureau also enumerated the residents of the  of ; its population was 3,808,610, an 8.1% increase over the number from a decade earlier.
In an introduction to a more detailed population profile (see ), the Census Bureau highlighted the following facts about U.S population dynamics:
* 75% of respondents said they were  and no other race;
*  accounted for 12.5% of the U.S. population, up from 9% in 1990;
* 12.4% (34.5 million Americans) were of  descent; s
* 12.3% were of Black or  descent;
* 3.6% of respondents were ;
* 2.4% (6.8 million Americans)Jayson, Sharon. "'Colorblind' Generation Doesn't Blink at interracial Relationships." USA TODAY. February 7, 2006: n.p. SIRS Researcher. Web. Oct 25, 2010. of respondents were  (2 or more races). The 2000 Census was the first time survey options for multiracial Americans were provided.
* Between 1990 and 2000, the population aged 45 to 54 grew by 49% and those aged 85 and older grew 38%;
* Women outnumbered men two to one among those aged 85 and older;
* Almost one in five adults had some type of  in 1997 and the likelihood of having a disability increased with age;
* Families (as opposed to men or women living alone) still dominated , but less so than they did thirty years ago;
* Since 1993, both families and non-families have seen median household incomes rise, with "households headed by a woman without a spouse present" growing the fastest;
* People in married-couple families had the lowest  rates;
* The poor of any age were more likely than others to lack  coverage;
* The number of  and  students in 2000 fell just short of the all-time high of 49 million reached in 1970;
* Improvements in educational attainment cross racial and ethnic lines; and
* The majority (51%) of U.S. households had access to ; 42% have .

==Reapportionment==
The results of the census are used to determine how many s each state is . Congress defines the formula, in accordance with Title 2 of the U.S. Code, to reapportion among the states the 435 seats in the . The apportionment population consists of the resident population of the fifty states, plus the overseas military and federal civilian employees and their dependents living with them who could be allocated to a state. Each member of the House represents a population of about 647,000. The populations of the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico are excluded from the apportionment population because they do not have voting seats in the U. S. House of Representatives.
Since , the decennial count has been the basis for the  representative form of government. Article I, Section II specifies that "The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative." In 1790, each member of the House represented about 34,000 residents. Since then, the House more than quadrupled in size, and in 1911 the  was fixed at 435. Today, each member represents about 20 times as many constituents.
==Adjustment controversy==
In the years leading up to the 2000 census, there was substantial controversy over whether the Bureau should adjust census figures based on a follow-up survey, called the post-enumeration survey, of a sample of blocks. (In 1999, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Constitution prohibits the use of such figures for apportionment purposes, but it may be permissible for other purposes where feasible.) The controversy was partly technical, but also partly political, since based on data from the 1990 census both parties believed that adjustment would likely have the effect, after redistricting, of slightly increasing Democratic representation in legislative bodies, but would also give Utah an additional, probably Republican, representative to Congress. 
Following the census, discrepancies between the adjusted census figures and demographic estimates of population change could not be resolved in time to meet legal deadlines for the provision of redistricting data, and the Census Bureau therefore recommended that the unadjusted results be used for this purpose. This recommendation was followed by the Secretary of Commerce (the official in charge of making the determination).
==Utah controversy==
After the census was tabulated,  challenged the results in two different ways. Utah was extremely close to gaining a fourth congressional seat, falling 857 people short, which in turn was allocated to . The margin was later shortened to 80 people, after the federal government discovered that it overcounted the population of North Carolina by 2,673 residents. The Census Bureau counted members of the military and other federal civilian employees serving abroad as residents of their home state but did not count other individuals living outside the United States. Utah claimed that individuals traveling abroad as religious missionaries should be counted as residents and that the failure to do so imposed a burden on  religious practice. Almost half of all Mormon missionaries, more than 11,000 individuals, were from Utah; only 102 came from North Carolina. If this policy were changed, then Utah would have received an additional seat instead of North Carolina. On November 26, 2002, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court ruling that rejected Utah's efforts to have Mormon missionaries counted.Greenhouse, Linda. , '''', November 27, 2001. Accessed July 16, 2008.
The state of Utah then filed another lawsuit alleging that the statistical methods used in computing the state populations were improper and cost Utah the seat. The Bureau uses a method called  to assign a number of residents to addresses where residents cannot be reached after multiple efforts. While nationwide the imputation method added .4% to the population, the rate in Utah was .2%. The state challenged that the use of imputation violates the Census Act of 1957 and that it also fails the Constitution's requirement in Article I, Section 2 that an "actual enumeration" be used for apportionment.Greenhouse, Linda. , '''', January 23, 2002.

==Gay and lesbian controversy==
The census forms did not include any questions regarding , making it impossible to compile data comparing heterosexual and homosexual populations. However, two questions ''were'' asked that allowed same-sex partnerships to be counted. The questionnaires asked the sex of each person in a household and they asked what the relationship was between each of the members of the household. Respondents could check "Husband/wife" or "unmarried partner" or a number of other relationships. Responses were tabulated and the  reported that there were more than 658,000 same-sex couples heading households in the United States. However, only about 25% of gay men and 40% of lesbians are in shared-household partnerships at any one time, according to non-Census surveys. For every same-sex couple tallied in the census, there could be three to six more homosexual un-partnered individuals who would not be counted as gay. The Census reported that same-sex male couples numbered 336,001 and female same-sex couples numbered 329,522. Extrapolating from those figures and the surveyed partnering habits of homosexuals, as many as 4.3 million homosexual adults could have been living in the U.S. in 2000. The exact number cannot be known because the Census did not count them specifically. Bisexual and transgender populations were not counted, either, because there were no questions regarding this information. Also unavailable is the number of additional same-sex couples living under the same roof as the first, though this applies to additional heterosexual couples as well. The lack of accurate numbers makes it difficult for lawmakers who are considering legislation on hate crimes or social services for gay families with children. It also makes for less accuracy when predicting the fertility of a population.
Another issue that concerned gay rights advocates involved the automatic changing of data during the tabulation process. This automatic software data compiling method, called , was designed to counteract mistakes and discrepancies in returned questionnaires. Forms that were filled out by two same-sex persons who checked the "Husband/wife" relationship box were treated as a discrepancy. The Census Bureau explained that  data samples were changed to "unmarried partner" by computer processing methods in 99% of the cases. In the remaining 1%, computer systems used one of two possibilities: a) one of the two listed sexes was changed, making the partnership appear heterosexual, or b) if the two partners were more than 15 years apart in age, they might have been reassigned into a familial parent/child relationship. The process of automatic reassignment of same-sex marriage data was initiated so that the Census Bureau would not contravene the  passed in 1996. The Act states:
With allocation moving married same-sex couples to the unmarried partner category, social scientists lost information that could have been extracted relating to the social stability of a same gender couple who identify themselves as married.
