==Storylines==
The storylines generally revolved around s on the evils of  and  using Newcomers as the discriminated minority. As fictional extraterrestrial immigrants, the Newcomers could stand in for  about African-Americans or Hispanics, as well as sexual minorities such as gays and lesbians, and would invert the usual expectations. For instance, during the run of the series, George became pregnant (the male of his species carrying the fetus for part of its gestation) and during much of the episode dialog included lines like, "If you females had to feel the pain we males feel during pregnancy, there wouldn't be any babies."  The series offered social commentary by illustrating what it means to be human and the often bizarre rituals we observe.

Johnson returned to the network, which envisioned a weekly science-fiction version of '''', and sold them on a different concept of social commentary about what happens when a new minority appears overnight.  He intended his version to be more akin to the film '''' than a traditional action film.
