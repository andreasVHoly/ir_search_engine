Client_(computing)
A '''client''' is a piece of  or  that accesses a service made available by a . The server is often (but not always) on another , in which case the client accesses the service by way of a .Sadoski, Darleen.

==Overview==
A client is a computer program that, as part of its operation, relies on sending a request to another  (which may or may not be located on another computer). For example, s are clients that connect to s and retrieve s for display. s retrieve  from s.  uses a variety of clients, which vary depending on the chat protocol being used. s or s may run as a client on each computer. The term "client" may also be applied to computers or devices that run the client software or users that use the client software.
A client is part of a , which is still used today. Clients and servers may be computer programs run on the same machine and connect via  techniques. Combined with s, programs may connect to a service operating on a possibly remote system through the . Servers wait for potential clients to initiate connections that they may accept.
The term was first applied to s that were not capable of running their own stand-alone s, but could interact with remote computers via a network. These s were clients of the  .
==Types==
In one classification, client computers and devices are either s, s, or s.
===Fat===
A ''fat client'', also known as a ''rich client'' or ''thick client'', is a client that performs the bulk of any data processing operations itself, and does not necessarily rely on the . The  is a common example of a fat client, because of its relatively large set of features and capabilities and its light reliance upon a server. For example, a computer running a  program (such as  or ) that ultimately shares the result of its work on a network is a fat client.
===Thin===
A ''thin client'' is a minimal sort of client.  Thin ''clients'' use the resources of the host computer. A thin client generally only presents processed data provided by an , which performs the bulk of any required data processing. A device using  (such as ) is a thin client.
===Hybrid===
A ''hybrid client'' is a mixture of the above two client models. Similar to a fat client, it processes locally, but relies on the server for storing persistent data. This approach offers features from both the fat client (multimedia support, high performance) and the thin client (high manageability, flexibility). A device running an online version of the   is an example of hybrid client.
