Back-side_bus
In   architecture, a '''back-side bus''' ('''BSB'''), or '''backside bus''', is a  used to connect the  to , usually L2. If a design utilizes it along with a  (FSB), it is said to use a '''dual-bus architecture''', or in 's terminology '''' (DIB) architecture.
==History==
BSB is an improvement over the older practice of using a single , because a single bus typically became a severe  as CPUs and memory speeds increased. Due to its dedicated nature, the back-side bus can be optimized for communication with cache, thus eliminating protocol overheads and additional signals that are required on a general-purpose bus.  Furthermore, since a BSB operates over a shorter distance, it can typically operate at higher clock speeds, increasing the computer's overall performance.
Cache connected with a BSB was initially external to the microprocessor , but now is usually on-die. In the latter case, the BSB  frequency is typically equal to the processor's, and the back-side bus can also be made much wider (256-bit, 512-bit) than either off-chip or on-chip FSB.
The dual-bus architecture was used in a number of designs, including the  and  (formerly the semiconductor division of )  processors (certain PowerPC  models, the  family, and the Freescale  line), as well as the   processor, 
which used it to access their L2 cache (earlier Intel processors accessed the L2 cache over the FSB, while later processors moved it on-chip).
