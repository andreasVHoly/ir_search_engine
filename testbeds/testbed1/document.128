Apache_Derby
'''Apache Derby''' (previously distributed as '''IBM Cloudscape''') is a  (RDBMS) developed by the  that can be embedded in  programs and used for . It has a 2.6  disk-space footprint.
Apache Derby is developed as an  project under the .  distributes the same binaries under the name '''Java DB'''.
==Derby technologies==
===Derby embedded database engine===
The core of the technology, Derby's database engine, is a full-functioned relational embedded database-engine, supporting  and  as programming APIs. It uses   syntax.
===Derby Network Server===
The Derby network server increases the reach of the Derby database engine by providing traditional client server functionality. The network server allows clients to connect over TCP/IP using the standard  protocol. The network server allows the Derby engine to support networked , /,  and .
===Embedded Network Server===
An embedded database can be configured to act as a hybrid server/embedded RDBMS; to also accept TCP/IP connections from other clients in addition to clients in the same JVM.see Embedded Server Example in 
===Database Utilities===
*ij: a tool that allows SQL scripts to be executed against any JDBC database.
*dblook: Schema extraction tool for a Derby database.
*sysinfo: Utility to display version numbers and class path.
==History==
Apache Derby originated at Cloudscape Inc, an , , start-up founded in 1996 by Nat Wyatt and Howard Torf to develop Java  technology. The first release of the database engine, then called JBMS, was in 1997. Subsequently the product was renamed Cloudscape and releases were made about every six months.
In 1999  Software, Inc., acquired Cloudscape, Inc. In 2001  acquired the database assets of Informix Software, including Cloudscape. The database engine was re-branded to IBM Cloudscape and releases continued, mainly focusing on embedded use with IBM's Java products and middleware.
In August 2004 IBM contributed the code to the  as Derby, an incubator project sponsored by the  project. In July 2005 the Derby project graduated from the Apache incubator and is now being developed as a sub-project of the  Top Level Project at Apache. Prior to Derby's graduation from incubation, Sun joined the Derby project with an intent to use Derby as a component in their own products, and with the release of Java 6 in December 2006, Sun started packaging Derby in the  branded as Java DB.
In March 2007 IBM announced that they would withdraw marketing and support for the Cloudscape product, but would continue to contribute to the Apache Derby project.
Currently (December 2013) Derby comes with Java 7 and has been branded as "JavaDB" but is exactly the same bit-for-bit as Derby is.  For developers wanting to use Java 6, they can still download Derby as before, but for developers requiring JRE 7 or later, Derby is included in the Java API.
