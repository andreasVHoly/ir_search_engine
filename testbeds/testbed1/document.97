Biography
A '''biography''' (or simply '''bio''') is a detailed description of a person's life.  It involves more than just the basic facts like education, work, relationships, and death, but also portrays a subject's experience of these life events.  Unlike a profile or  (), a biography presents a subject's life story, highlighting various aspects of his or her life, including intimate details of experience, and may include an analysis of the subject's personality.
Biographical works are usually , but fiction can also be used to portray a person's life. One in-depth form of  biographical coverage is called legacy writing. Works in diverse media, from literature to film, form the  known as biography.
An '''authorized biography''' is written with the permission, cooperation, and at times, participation of a subject or a subject's heirs. An '''''' is written by the person himself or herself, sometimes with the assistance of a collaborator or .
== History ==
At first, biographical writings were regarded merely as a subsection of history with a focus on a particular individual of historical importance. The independent genre of biography as distinct from general history writing, began to emerge in the 18th century and reached its contemporary form at the turn of the 20th century.
=== Historical biography ===
One of the earliest of the biographers was , and his '''', published about 80 A.D., covers prominent figures in the  world.  In 44 B.C.  published a biographical work, his ''Excellentium Imperatorum Vitae'' ("Lives of those capable of commanding"). Perhaps the earliest extant biography that does not contain mythological material is '''' by .
In the early  (AD 400 to 1450) there was a decline in awareness of the  culture in Europe. During this time, the only repositories of knowledge and records of the early history in Europe were those of the .  s, s, and s used this historic period to write biographies.  Their subjects were usually restricted to the s, s, s, and s.  Their works were meant to be inspirational to the people and vehicles for  to  (see ). One significant secular example of a biography from this period is the  by his courtier .
In  (c. AD 750 to 1258), similar traditional Muslim biographies of  and other important figures in the early  began to be written, beginning the  tradition. Early  were published as compendia of famous Islamic personalities from the 9th century onwards. They contained more social data for a large segment of the population than other works of that period. The earliest biographical dictionaries initially focused on the lives of the  and , with one of these early examples being '''' by . And then began the documentation of the lives of many other historical figures (from rulers to scholars) who lived in the medieval Islamic world.
By the late Middle Ages, biographies became less church-oriented in Europe as biographies of s, s, and s began to appear.  The most famous of such biographies was '''' by Sir .  The book was an account of the life of the fabled  and his . Following Malory, the new emphasis on  during the  promoted a focus on secular subjects, such as artists and poets, and encouraged writing in the vernacular.
's '''' (1550) was the landmark biography focusing on secular lives. Vasari made celebrities of his subjects, as the ''Lives'' became an early "bestseller".  Two other developments are noteworthy: the development of the  in the 15th century and the gradual increase in .
Biographies in the English language began appearing during the reign of . 's '''' (1563), better known as ''Foxe's Book of Martyrs'', was essentially the first dictionary of the biography in Europe, followed by 's ''The History of the Worthies of England'' (1662), with a distinct focus on public life.
Influential in shaping popular conceptions of pirates, '''' (1724), by Charles Johnson, is the prime source for the biographies of many well-known pirates.. Introduction and commentary by . Conway Maritime Press (2002).
The American biography followed the English model, incorporating 's view that biography was a part of history. Carlyle asserted that the lives of great human beings were essential to understanding society and its institutions. While the historical impulse would remain a strong element in early American biography, American writers carved out a distinct approach. What emerged was a rather didactic form of biography, which sought to shape the individual character of a reader in the process of defining national character.
=== Emergence of the genre ===
The first modern biography, and a work which exerted considerable influence on the evolution of the genre, was 's '''', a biography of lexicographer and man-of-letters  published in 1791. While Boswell's personal acquaintance with his subject only began in 1763, when Johnson was 54 years old, Boswell covered the entirety of Johnson's life by means of additional research. Itself an important stage in the development of the modern  of biography, it has been claimed to be the greatest biography written in the . Boswell's work was unique in its level of research, which involved archival study, eye-witness accounts and interviews, its robust and attractive narrative, and its honest depiction of all aspects of Johnson's life and character - a formula which serves as the basis of biographical literature to this day.
Biographical writing generally stagnated during the 19th century - in many cases there was a reversal to the more familiar  method of eulogizing the dead, similar to the biographies of s produced in  times. A distinction between mass biography and  began to form by the middle of the century, reflecting a breach between high culture and  culture. However, the number of biographies in print experienced a rapid growth, thanks to an expanding reading public. This revolution in publishing made books available to a larger audience of readers. In addition, affordable  editions of popular biographies were published for the first time. s began publishing a sequence of biographical sketches.
 became more popular, as with the rise of education and cheap printing, modern concepts of fame and celebrity began to develop. Autobiographies were written by authors, such as  (who incorporated autobiographical elements in his novels) and , (his ''Autobiography'' appeared posthumously, quickly becoming a bestseller in ), philosophers, such as , churchmen    and entertainers  .
=== Modern biography ===
The sciences of  and  were ascendant at the turn of the 20th century and would heavily influence the new centurys biographies. The demise of the  theory of history was indicative of the emerging mindset. Human behavior would be explained through  theories. "Sociological" biographies conceived of their subjects' actions as the result of the environment, and tended to downplay individuality. The development of  led to a more penetrating and comprehensive understanding of the biographical subject, and induced biographers to give more emphasis to  and . Clearly these psychological ideas were changing the way biographies were written, as a culture of autobiography developed, in which the telling of one's own story became a form of therapy. The conventional concept of heroes and narratives of success disappeared in the obsession with psychological explorations of personality.
British critic  revolutionized the art of biographical writing with his 1918 work '''', consisting of biographies of four leading figures from the , , ,  and . Strachey set out to breathe life into the  for future generations to read. Up until this point, as Strachey remarked in the preface, Victorian biographies had been "as familiar as the ''cortge'' of the undertaker", and wore the same air of "slow, funereal barbarism." Strachey defied the tradition of "two fat volumes....of undigested masses of material" and took aim at the four iconic figures. His narrative demolished the myths that had built up around these cherished national heroes, whom he regarded as no better than a "set of mouth bungled hypocrites". The book achieved worldwide fame due to its irreverent and witty style, its concise and factually accurate nature, and its artistic prose.
In the 1920s and '30s, biographical writers sought to capitalize on Strachey's popularity by imitating his style. This new school featured iconoclasts, scientific analysts, and fictional biographers and included , , and , among others.  (''I, Claudius'', 1934) stood out among those following Strachey's model of "debunking biographies." The trend in literary biography was accompanied in popular biography by a sort of "celebrity voyeurism", in the early decades of the century. This latter form's appeal to readers was based on curiosity more than morality or patriotism. By , cheap hard-cover reprints had become popular. The decades of the 1920s witnessed a biographical "boom."
The feminist scholar  observed that women's biographies and autobiographies began to change character during the second wave of  activism. She cited  1970 biography ''Zelda'', as the "beginning of a new period of women's biography, because " in 1970 were we ready to read not that  had destroyed , but Fitzgerald her: he had usurped her narrative." Heilbrun named 1973 as the turning point in women's autobiography, with the publication of  ''Journal of a Solitude,'' for that was the first instance where a woman told her life story, not as finding "beauty even in pain" and transforming "rage into spiritual acceptance," but acknowledging what had previously been forbidden to women: their pain, their rage, and their "open admission of the desire for power and control over one's life."
===Recent years===
In recent years,  biography has become more popular than traditional literary forms. Along with documentary s,  produced numerous commercial films based on the lives of famous people. The popularity of these forms of biography have led to the proliferation of TV channels dedicated to biography, including ,  and .
CD-ROM and online biographies have also appeared. Unlike books and films, they often do not tell a chronological narrative: instead they are archives of many discrete media elements related to an individual person, including video clips, photographs, and text articles. Biography-Portraits were created in 2001, by the German artist . Media scholar  says that such archives exemplify the database form, allowing users to navigate the materials in many ways. General "life writing" techniques are a subject of scholarly study.
In recent years, debates have arisen as to whether all biographies are fiction, especially when authors are writing about figures from the past. President of Wolfston College at Oxford University,  argues that all history is seen through a perspective that is the product of our contemporary society and as a result  biographical truths are constantly shifting. So the history biographers write about will not be the way that it happened; It will be the way they remembered it. Debates have also arisen concerning the importance of space in life-writing.
=== Biographical research ===
Biographical research is defined by Miller as a research method that collects and analyses a person's whole life, or portion of a life, through the in-depth and unstructured interview, or sometimes reinforced by semi-structured interview or personal documents. It is a way of viewing social life in procedural terms, rather than static terms. The information can come from "oral history, personal narrative, biography and autobiography or "diaries, letters, memoranda and other materials". The central aim of biographical research is producing rich descriptions of persons or "conceptualise structural types of actions" which means to "understand the action logics or how persons and structures are interlinked". And this method can be used to understand an individuals life within its social context or understand the cultural phenomena.
