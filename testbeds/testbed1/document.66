Head_transplant
A '''head transplant''' is a  which involves the grafting of one organism's head onto the body of another. Head transplantation involves  the patient. Head transplants have been successfully performed on dogs and monkeys by surgeons, although all the animals were unable to move and died shortly afterwards. No human has undergone the procedure.
==History==
 succeeded in grafting one dog's head onto the side of another's neck on 21 May 1908.
 experimented with dog head transplantation in the  in the 1950s. His transplant subjects typically died due to immune reactions.
In 1959, China claimed that they had succeeded in transplanting the head of one dog to the body of another twice.
Dr. Vladimir Demikhov's work, among others, was deeply influential for the future science of organ transplant,,  as he pioneered many different forms of transplant in the 1940s and 1950s, including the use of immuno-suppressants. His work was well known by other scientists and during the 1950s and 1960s, numerous heart transplants were performed on dogs in the United States by Dr. Norman Shumway of Stanford University and Dr. Richard Lower of the Medical College of Virginia. The first human heart transplant was performed by  in South Africa, in 1967, however, as they did not have the chemical agents to utilize immuno-suppressants, the patient receiving the transplant did not do very well.
On March 14, 1970, a group of scientists from  School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio, led by , a  and a professor of neurological  who was inspired by the work of , performed a highly controversial operation to transplant the head of one monkey onto another's body. The procedure was a success to some extent, with the animal being able to smell, taste, hear, and see the world around it. The operation involved  arteries and veins carefully while the head was being severed to prevent . Because the nerves were left entirely intact, connecting the brain to a blood supply kept it chemically alive. The animal survived for some time after the operation, even at times attempting to bite some of the staff.  In 2001, Dr. White successfully repeated the operation on a monkey.
White later wrote:
In 2002, other head transplants were also conducted in  in s.  Unlike the head transplants performed by Dr. White, however, these head transplants involved grafting one rat's head onto the body of another rat that kept its head.  Thus, the rat ended up with two heads. The scientists said that the key to successful head transplants was to use low temperatures.
The ability of fusogens like  and  to rebridge a transected spinal cord has been confirmed by a 2014 German study: paraplegic rats recovered motricity within 1 month.
In 2015, Italian neurosurgeon  has said the procedure (head anastomosis venture) might be feasible &ndash; with improved technology and more accurate ability to keep neural tissue perfused &ndash; before the end of 2017, which is when he intends to perform the procedure in either the United States or China.  A 30-year-old Russian programmer Valery Spiridonov with WerdnigHoffmann disease (type I ) and rapidly declining health has volunteered to offer his head for the study.
==Popular opinion==
Popular opinion about potential head transplantation has been generally negative, despite Italian neurosurgeon Sergio Canavero's claims in early 2015 that he will be able to perform a successful head transplant, complete with a functional patient, by 2017. These claims against Canavero do not take a moral or ethical stance, but rather focus on the state of technology and the timeframe in which Canavero says he will be able to successfully conduct the procedure.
Robert J. White, the scientist who transplanted a monkey's head, became a leading target for protestors. One interrupted a banquet in his honor by offering him a bloody replica of a human head. Others called his house asking for "Dr. Butcher." When a surgeon testified in a civil hearing about Dr. 's murder case, lawyer  compared Dr. White to Dr. ., , , (September 16, 2010). The  described White's experiments as "epitomizing the crude, cruel vivisection industry."Carla Bennett, , '''',  , (August 21, 1995).
Dr. , an expert in regrowing severed nerves, stated "I think  fairly barbaric at this point. I do not even see that 100 years from now it is a possibility. If anybody did that today, it would be absolutely horrible. Can you imagine looking around the room, and you're just a head?", , Page 57, (April 4, 2013).
