James is maintained by contributors to the , with initial contributions by .  support has been added as of preview version 3.0-M2, which now requires Java 1.5 or later.
The James project manages the Apache Mailet  which defines "matchers" and "mailets". These allow users to write their own mail-handling code, such as to update a database, build a message archive, or filter . A matcher is used to classify messages based on some criteria, and then determines whether the message should be passed to an appropriate mailet for processing. Mailets are so-called due to their conceptual similarity to a , and arose because  declined a proposal to include mail-handling in the servlet implementation. James ships with a variety of pre-written matchers and mailets to serve common tasks. Many sets of mailets and matchers can be combined to produce sophisticated and complex functional behaviour.
The Apache James project also produces pure Java libraries for implementing Sender Policy Framework (SPF), the  mail filtering language, and parsing MIME content streams, independent of Sun's JavaMail API.
