==Gameplay==
The player begins every round atop inflating stations.  These inflating stations, which are scattered throughout the arenas, also act as checkpoints.  Remaining atop an inflating station for too long will cause the player to burst.  A bar gauge at the bottom of the screen allows the player to monitor their air level.
Navigating the levels is accomplished with the directional buttons and a jump button.  The view is , which can often make complicated movements (such as jumping across gaps or weaving through obstacles) difficult.
Points are gathered in the form of gems that appear randomly in rooms.  Players pass through the gems for collection.
Airball can ascend stairs by jumping.  The surrounding spikes, one of many obstacles found in the game, cause the player to burst.  The yellow bar is the amount of air left in the ball, and the three balls in the lower left of the screen indicate the remaining lives.  The isometric projection is very visible in this image.
