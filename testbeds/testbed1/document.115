The '''American Computer & Robotics Museum''', formerly known as the '''American Computer Museum''', is a museum of the history of computing, communications, artificial intelligence & robotics that is located in , , USA. It was founded in May 1990 by Barbara and George Keremedjiev as a non-profit organization and will be celebrating its 25th anniversary in May 2015.  The museum is also known as the American Computer & Robotics Museum. The museum was originally intended to have been located in , but the location was changed when the founders moved to .  It is likely the oldest extant museum dedicated to the history of computers in the world. '''' in  opened first, but it closed in 1999.
The museum's mission is: "To collect, preserve, interpret, and display the artifacts and history of the information age."
