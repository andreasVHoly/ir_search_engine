'''Batik''' is a pure- library that can be used to render, generate, and manipulate  graphics.  (SVG is an  markup language for describing two-dimensional .) IBM supported the project and then donated the code to the , where other companies and teams decided to join efforts.
Batik provides a set of core modules that provide functionality to:
* Render and dynamically modify SVG content,
* Transcode SVG content to some raster s, such as ,  and ,
* Transcode s to SVG (WMF or Windows Metafile Format is the vector format used by  applications),
