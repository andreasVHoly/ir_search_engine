3M_computer
'''3M''' was a goal first proposed in the early 1980s by  and his colleagues at  (CMU) as a minimum specification for academic/technical s: at least a '''' of memory, a '''' display and a '''' (MIPS) processing power. It was also often said that it should cost no more than a "''megapenny''" ($10,000).
At that time a typical desktop computer such as an early  might have 1/8 of a megabyte of memory (128K), 1/4 of a million pixels (640x400 monochrome display), and run at 0.33 million instructions per second (5Mhz 8088).
The concept was inspired by the  which had been designed in the 1970s at the . Several Altos were donated to CMU, Stanford, and MIT in 1979.
An early 3M computer was the  Workstation made by . The PERQ had a 1 million P-codes ( instructions) per second processor, 256 KB of RAM (upgradeable to 1 MB), and a 7681024 pixel display on a  display.  While not quite a true 3M machine, it was used as the initial 3M machine for the CMU Scientific Personal Integrated Computing Environment (SPICE) workstation project.
The  , designed by  in 1980, is another example. It was then commercialized by  in 1982.  (in the  region) announced the  computer in 1981. By 1986 CMU stated that it expected at least two companies to introduce 3M computers by the end of the year, with academic pricing of $3,000 and retail pricing of $5,000, and Stanford University planned to deploy them in s. The first "megapenny" 3M workstation was the   with a list price of $8,900 in 1986.
The original  was introduced in 1988 as a 3M machine by , who first heard this term at . Its so-called "" display had just over 930,000 pixels with four shades of gray. However, floating point performance, powered with the Motorola  FPU was only about .25 .
Modern desktop computers exceed the 3M memory and speed requirements by many thousands of times, though the screen pixels are only 2 or 3 times larger (but full color so each pixel uses at least 24 times as many bits).
