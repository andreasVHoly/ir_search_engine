Apple_ProFile
The '''ProFile''' was the first  produced by , initially for use with the  . The original model had a formatted capacity of 5  and connected to a special interface card that plugged into an Apple III slot. In 1983 Apple offered a ProFile interface card for the , with software support for  and .
Also in 1983, Apple introduced the  computer, which was normally sold with a ProFile.  The ProFile could be connected to the built-in parallel port of the Lisa, or to a port of an optional dual-port parallel interface card.  Up to three such interface cards could be installed, so in principle up to seven ProFile drives could be used on a Lisa.
The 5 MB ProFile was Apple's first hard drive, and was introduced in September 1981 at a price of  3499.  Later a 10 MB model was offered, but required an upgraded /interface card to recognize the additional 5 MB.
Internally, the ProFile consisted of a bare   stepper motor drive and mechanism, without the usual Seagate electronics, a digital and an analog circuit board designed and manufactured by Apple, and a power supply.
Later Lisa models could be configured with an internal 10 MB ""  drive with a proprietary controller designed and built entirely by Apple, but the Widget was never offered as an external product for use with other Apple computers.
Apple did not offer another hard drive until it released the  designed specifically for the  in September 1985 which could not be used on the Apple II or III families, or Lisa series. The ProFile could not be used on the Macintosh or the  computer (for which Apple never offered an external hard disk drive of any kind).
By September 1986, the ProFile would be superseded by the introduction of the first cross-platform  SCSI-based drive for the Macintosh and interface card for the Apple II family (excluding the IIc series, which had no SCSI interface of any kind) and Lisa/XL series.
