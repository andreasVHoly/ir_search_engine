==Location and history==

The farm consists of  surrounded by ridges of the Appalachian mountains, and is  north of Knoxville.from http://www.childrensdefense.org/who-is-cdf/cdf-contacts-state-offices/cdf-haley-farm/; Lamb, 1994.   The grounds of the farm include streams, a lake, an apple orchard, and a ropes course.Lamb, 1994; Abif, K. K. (2002, February) Respite on the farm. American Libraries, 33(2), 52-54.
The Langston Hughes Library was dedicated on March 19, 1999.  The dedication ceremony was attended by such important figures as Maya Angelou, Hillary Rodham Clinton, John Franklin, and Toni Morrison.http://www.e-zing.net/LHL/history.htm  The Childrens Defense Fund and its sister organization, the Black Community Crusade for Children, run this library  "as an incubator for the CDFs Leave No Child Behind movement.Abif, 2002, p. 52
==The building==
The Library is a 1,200 square foot 2-story building with a single reading room upstairs and entryway and a small bookstore in the south corn crib.: http://goodchurchdesign.blogspot.com/2008/01/maya-lins-langston-hughes-library.html; (Arcady, 2008; Lin, M. Y. (2000). Boundaries. New York: Simon & Schuster, p. 10:24   The reading room was designed to be a flexible space, allowing for public readings or personal study areas, as needed.
An 1860s refurbished barn and two corn cribs comprise the exterior skin of the building.http://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/lin/  The rustic exterior, which evokes the architectural vernacular of 19th-century East Tennessee, a plain language of silvery, time-worn siding, rough logs, and minimal geometries is melded with modern Shaker-like simplicity on the interior.Kreyling, C. (2000). Lin Finds New Use for Old Barn at Langston Hughes Library. Architectural Record, 188(5), 48
Maya Lin pointed out that the function of the exterior and that of the interior were different and thus she "wanted to make a real cut between outside and insidethere didn't seem to be much point in preserving the rustic feel of the barn's interior.Kreyling, 2000.
One of the most striking aspects of the design are the glass-encased corn cribs that act as a base for the cantelievered barn that sits atop them.  Margaret Butler of Martella Associates states that the glass between the logs "glows like a Chinese lantern" at night.
===The architect===
The Library was designed by Maya Lin, most famous for her Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington DC., and who also created the  in Montgomery, AL.  Martella Associates, Knoxville, were the architect of record.
Lin explains her vision: "The idea was to maintain the integrity and character of the old barn yet introduce a new inner layerexpressing the idea of a separate inner skin slipping inside the old barn".Lin, 2000, p. 10:24  "I'd never seen a shape like that before and wanted to save it.once I realized that the book collection was small and the library would be used as an intimate gathering space, I came up with the concept of an elevated reading room".
===Building materials===
The exterior skin consists of a reclaimed barn and two corncribs, held together with glass and steel bars. Crib walls are supported by threaded steel rod, expressing this new architectural element, instead of hiding it.Crosbie, M.J. (2003). Architecture for the Books. Victoria, Australia: The Images Publishing Group p. 220.
The interior spaces use new materials: maple and particleboard, sisal mats and recycled soybean husk tabletops designed by Lin.Crosbie, 2003, p. 221; Lin, 2000, p. 10:29, The materials chosen were either recycled or green.  Natural daylight floods the interiors via large skylights and windows, reducing the need for artificial lighting.  The exterior space between the two cribs incorporates a small stone fountain that gives the transitory space a new life and making a positive space out of a void.Lin, 2000, p. 10:29 A nearby pond is used as a natural heat exchanger to help reduce the library's energy costs.
===Critical response===
A critic for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer appreciates the quiet, reductive clarity of her work and states that Lin has transformed a barn into a Frank Gehry-like marvel of colored light and air.Hackett, R. (2000, October 19). Maya Lin emerges from the shadows. Seattle Post-Intelligencer.  Alex Ross  of Stanford University considers the library a marvelous example of adaptive re-use.
==The library==
The Childrens Defense Fund purpose in building the Langston Hughes Library was to connects young leaders and activists with the glorious heritage of the struggle for freedom, and is where policy makers and community builders come to connect, recharge their spiritual and physical batteries and act as a training ground for the next generation of leadership, advocacy and service for children and families.http://www.childrensdefense.org/who-is-cdf/cdf-contacts-state-offices/cdf-haley-farm/
Architect Maya Lin states that her mission in creating the library was to create a fluid transition between a building and its site, so that you will always feel connected to the land(.Lin, 2000, p. 12:29
