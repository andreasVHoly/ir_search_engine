Bivalirudin
'''Bivalirudin''' (Angiomax or Angiox, manufactured by The Medicines Company) is a specific and reversible  (DTI).
Chemically, it is a synthetic  of the naturally occurring drug  (found in the saliva of the medicinal leech ''Hirudo medicinalis'').
Bivalirudin is a DTI that overcomes many limitations seen with indirect thrombin inhibitors, such as . Bivalirudin is a short, synthetic peptide that is potent, highly specific, and a reversible inhibitor of . It inhibits both circulating and clot-bound thrombin, while also inhibiting thrombin-mediated platelet activation and aggregation. Bivalirudin has a quick onset of action and a short half-life. It does not bind to plasma proteins (other than thrombin) or to red blood cells. Therefore, it has a predictable antithrombotic response. There is no risk for /Heparin Induced Thrombosis-Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (HIT/HITTS). It does not require a binding cofactor such as antithrombin and does not activate platelets. These characteristics make bivalirudin an ideal alternative to heparin.
Bivalirudin clinical studies demonstrated consistent positive outcomes in patients with stable , unstable angina (UA), non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing PCI  in 7 major randomized trials. Patients receiving bivalirudin had fewer adverse events compared to patients that received heparin.
==Indications==
'''''US (United States) Indications''''':
*Bivalirudin is indicated for use as an anticoagulant in patients with unstable angina undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).
*Bivalirudin with provisional use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (GPI) is indicated for use as an anticoagulant in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
*Bivalirudin is indicated for patients with, or at risk of HIT/HITTS undergoing PCI.
*Bivalirudin is intended for use with aspirin and has been studied only in patients receiving concomitant aspirin
'''''EU (European) indications''''':
*Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI), including patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary PCI.
*Bivalirudin is also indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unstable angina/non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) planned for urgent or early intervention.
*Bivalirudin should be administered with aspirin and clopidogrel.
==Basic chemical and pharmacological properties==
'''Mechanism of action'''''
Bivalirudin directly inhibits thrombin by specifically binding both to the catalytic site and to the anion-binding exosite of circulating and clot-bound thrombin. Thrombin is a serine proteinase that plays a central role in the thrombotic process. It cleaves fibrinogen into fibrin monomers, activates Factor V, VIII, and XIII, allowing fibrin to develop a covalently cross-linked framework that stabilizes the thrombus. Thrombin also promotes further thrombin generation, and activates platelets, stimulating aggregation and granule release. The binding of bivalirudin to thrombin is reversible as thrombin slowly cleaves the bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4 bond, resulting in recovery of thrombin active site functions.
'''Pharmacokinetics'''
*Following an IV bolus of bivalirudin of 1&nbsp;mg/kg and a 4-hour 2.5&nbsp;mg/kg/h IV infusion a mean steady state concentration of 12.3  1.7&nbsp;g/mL is achieved
*Bivalirudin is cleared from plasma by a combination of renal mechanisms and proteolytic cleavage
*Half-life:
-Normal renal function (&nbsp;90&nbsp;mL/min) = 25 minutes
-Mild renal dysfunction (6089&nbsp;mL/min) = 22 minutes
-Moderate renal dysfunction (30-59&nbsp;mL/min) = 34 minutes
-Severe renal dysfunction (&nbsp;29&nbsp;mL/min) = 57 minutes
-Dialysis-dependent  = 3.5 hours
*Clearance is reduced approximately 20% in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment and by 80% in dialysis-dependent patients
*Bivalirudin is hemodialyzable and approximately 25% is cleared by hemodialysis.
'''Pharmacodynamics'''
Coagulation times return to baseline approximately 1 hour following cessation of bivalirudin administration.
==Dosing and administration==
Bivalirudin is intended for IV use only and is supplied as a sterile, lyophilized product in single-use, glass vials. After reconstitution, each vial delivers 250&nbsp;mg of bivalirudin.
'''''US dosing''''':
*PCI Bolus: 0.75&nbsp;mg/kg
*PCI Infusion: 1.75&nbsp;mg/kg/h
'''''EU dosing''''':
*UA/NSTEMI
-Bolus: 0.1&nbsp;mg/kg
-Infusion: 0.25&nbsp;mg/kg/h for up to 72 hours for medical management
-If patient proceeds to PCI, an additional bolus of 0.5&nbsp;mg/kg of bivalirudin should be administered before the procedure and the infusion increased to 1.75&nbsp;mg/kg/h for the duration of the procedure.
*PCI
-Bolus: 0.75&nbsp;mg/kg
-Infusion: 1.75&nbsp;mg/kg/h
*Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG)
-Patients proceeding to CABG surgery off-pump:
The IV infusion of bivalirudin should be continued until the time of surgery. Just prior to surgery, a 0.5&nbsp;mg/kg bolus dose should be administered followed by a 1.75&nbsp;mg/kg/h infusion for the duration of the surgery.
-Patients proceeding to CABG surgery on-pump:
The IV infusion of bivalirudin should be continued until 1 hour prior to surgery after which the infusion should be discontinued
Five minutes after the bolus dose has been administered, an activating clotting time (ACT) should be performed and an additional bolus of 0.3&nbsp;mg/kg should be given if needed.
Continuation of the bivalirudin infusion following PCI for up to 4 hours post-procedure is optional, at the discretion of the treating physician. After 4 hours, an additional IV infusion of bivalirudin may be initiated at a rate of 0.2 or 0.25&nbsp;mg/kg/h for up to 20 hours, if needed.
Bivalirudin should be administered with optimal antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel).
'''''Renal impairment'''''
A reduction in the infusion dose of bivalirudin should be considered in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. If a patient is on hemodialysis, the infusion should be reduced to 0.25&nbsp;mg/kg/h. No reduction in the bolus dose is needed.
==Safety information==
Bivalirudin is contraindicated in patients with active major bleeding and hypersensitivity to bivalirudin or its components. (In the EU bivalirudin is also contraindicated in patients with an increased risk of bleeding due to hemostasis disorders and/or irreversible coagulation disorders, severe uncontrolled hypertension, subacute bacterial endocarditis, and severe renal impairment
