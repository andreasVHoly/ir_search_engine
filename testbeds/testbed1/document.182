3D_modeling
In , '''3D modeling''' (or '''modelling''') is the process of developing a mathematical representation of any  '''surface''' of an object (either inanimate or living) via . The product is called a '''3D model'''. It can be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called '''' or used in a  of physical phenomena. The model can also be physically created using  devices.
Models may be created automatically or manually. The manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to  such as .
'''3D modeling software''' is a class of  used to produce 3D models. Individual programs of this class are called '''modeling applications''' or '''modelers'''.
==Models==
3D models represent a  using a collection of points in 3D space, connected by various geometric entities such as triangles, lines, curved surfaces, etc. Being a collection of data (s and other information), 3D models can be created by hand, ically (), or .
3D models are widely used anywhere in  and . Actually, their use predates the widespread use of 3D graphics on s. Many s used pre-rendered images of 3D models as s before computers could render them in real-time.
Today, 3D models are used in a wide variety of fields. The medical industry uses detailed models of organs; these may be created with multiple 2-D image slices from an MRI or CT scan. The movie industry uses them as characters and objects for animated and real-life . The  uses them as assets for . The  sector uses them as highly detailed models of chemical compounds. The architecture industry uses them to demonstrate proposed buildings and landscapes in lieu of traditional, physical s. The engineering community uses them as designs of new devices, vehicles and structures as well as a host of other uses. In recent decades the  community has started to construct 3D geological models as a standard practice. 3D models can also be the basis for physical devices that are built with s or s.
===Representation===
Almost all 3D models can be divided into two categories.
* '''Solid''' - These models define the volume of the object they represent (like a rock). These are more realistic, but more difficult to build. Solid models are mostly used for nonvisual simulations such as medical and engineering simulations, for CAD and specialized visual applications such as  and 
* '''Shell/boundary''' - these models represent the surface, e.g. the boundary of the object, not its volume (like an infinitesimally thin eggshell). These are easier to work with than solid models. Almost all visual models used in games and film are shell models.
Because the appearance of an object depends largely on the exterior of the object, s are common in computer graphics. Two dimensional s are a good analogy for the objects used in graphics, though quite often these objects are non-. Since surfaces are not finite, a discrete digital approximation is required:  (and to a lesser extent ) are by far the most common representation, although  representations have been gaining some popularity in recent years. s are a useful representation for deforming surfaces which undergo many topological changes such as .
The process of transforming representations of objects, such as the middle point coordinate of a  and a point on its  into a polygon representation of a sphere, is called . This step is used in polygon-based rendering, where objects are broken down from abstract representations ("primitives") such as spheres,  etc., to so-called ''meshes'', which are nets of interconnected triangles. Meshes of triangles (instead of e.g. s) are popular as they have proven to be easy to render using ., , August 22, 2008 Polygon representations are not used in all rendering techniques, and in these cases the tessellation step is not included in the transition from abstract representation to rendered scene.
==Modeling process==
There are three popular ways to represent a model:
# '''''' - Points in 3D space, called '''vertices''', are connected by line segments to form a . The vast majority of 3D models today are built as textured polygonal models, because they are flexible and because computers can render them so quickly. However, polygons are planar and can only approximate curved surfaces using many polygons.
# '''Curve modeling''' - Surfaces are defined by curves, which are influenced by weighted control points. The curve follows (but does not necessarily interpolate) the points. Increasing the weight for a point will pull the curve closer to that point. Curve types include  (NURBS), splines, patches, and 
# '''''' - Still a fairly new method of modeling, 3D sculpting has become very popular in the few years it has been around. There are currently three types of digital sculpting: Displacement, which is the most widely used among applications at this moment, uses a dense model (often generated by s of a polygon control mesh) and stores new locations for the vertex positions through use of a 32bit image map that stores the adjusted locations. Volumetric, loosely based on s, has similar capabilities as displacement but does not suffer from polygon stretching when there are not enough polygons in a region to achieve a deformation.  is similar to voxel but divides the surface using triangulation to maintain a smooth surface and allow finer details. These methods allow for very artistic exploration as the model will have a new topology created over it once the models form and possibly details have been sculpted. The new mesh will usually have the original high resolution mesh information transferred into displacement data or normal map data if for a game engine.
The modeling stage consists of shaping individual objects that are later used in the scene. There are a number of modeling techniques, including:
* 
* s
* s
Modeling can be performed by means of a dedicated program (e.g., , , , , , ) or an application component (Shaper, Lofter in 3ds Max) or some scene description language (as in ). In some cases, there is no strict distinction between these phases; in such cases modeling is just part of the scene creation process (this is the case, for example, with Caligari  and ).
Complex materials such as blowing sand, clouds, and liquid sprays are modeled with s, and are a mass of 3D s which have either , s, s, or  assigned to them.
==Compared to 2D methods==
3D  effects are often achieved without wireframe modeling and are sometimes indistinguishable in the final form. Some  includes filters that can be applied to 2D vector graphics or 2D  on transparent layers.
Advantages of wireframe 3D modeling over exclusively 2D methods include:
* ''Flexibility,'' ability to change angles or animate images with quicker rendering of the changes;
* ''Ease of rendering,'' automatic calculation and rendering photorealistic effects rather than mentally visualizing or estimating;
* ''Accurate photorealism,'' less chance of human error in misplacing, overdoing, or forgetting to include a visual effect.
Disadvantages compare to 2D photorealistic rendering may include a software learning curve and difficulty achieving certain photorealistic effects. Some photorealistic effects may be achieved with special rendering filters included in the 3D modeling software. For the best of both worlds, some artists use a combination of 3D modeling followed by editing the 2D computer-rendered images from the 3D model.
==3D model market==
A large market for 3D models (as well as 3D-related content, such as textures, scripts, etc.) still exists - either for individual models or large collections. Online marketplaces for 3D content, such as , The3DStudio, , CreativeCrash, CGTrader, FlatPyramid, NoneCG, CGPeopleNetwork, Design Connected and  , allow individual artists to sell content that they have created. Often, the artists' goal is to get additional value out of assets they have previously created for projects. By doing so, artists can earn more money out of their old content, and companies can save money by buying pre-made models instead of paying an employee to create one from scratch. These marketplaces typically split the sale between themselves and the artist that created the asset, artists get 40% to 95% of the sales according to the marketplace. In most cases, the artist retains ownership of the 3d model; the customer only buys the right to use and present the model. Some artists sell their products directly in its own stores offering their products at a lower price by not using intermediaries.
Over the last several years numerous marketplaces specialized in 3D printing models have emerged. Some of the s are combination of models sharing sites, with or without a built in e-com capability. Some of those platforms also offer 3D printing services on demand, software for model rendering and dynamic viewing of items, etc. Among the most popular 3D printing file sharing platforms are , , , , , , ,  and .
==3D printing==
3D printing is a form of additive manufacturing technology where a three dimensional object is created by laying down successive layers of material.
In recent years, there has been an upsurge in the number of companies offering personalised 3D printed models of objects that have been scanned, rendered in three dimensions in computer software, and then printed to the customer's requirements. As previously mentioned, 3D models can be purchased from online marketplaces and printed by individuals or companies using commercially available 3D printers, enabling the home-production of objects such as spare parts, and even medical equipment.
==Human models==
The first widely available commercial application of human virtual models appeared in 1998 on the  web site. The human virtual models were created by the company My Virtual Mode Inc. and enabled users to create a model of themselves and try on 3D clothing. There are several modern programs that allow for the creation of virtual human models ( being one example).
==3D Clothing==
The development of cloth simulation software such as Marvelous Designer, CLO3D and Optitex, has enabled artists and fashion designers to model dynamic 3D clothing on the computer. 
Dynamic 3D clothing is used for virtual fashion catalogs, as well as for dressing 3D characters for video games, 3D animation movies, for digital doubles in movies as well as for making clothes for avatars in virtual worlds such as .
==Uses==
3D modeling is used in various industries like films, animation and gaming,  and . They are also used in the medical industry for the interactive representations of anatomy. A wide number of 3D software are also used in constructing digital representation of mechanical models or parts before they are actually manufactured.  related software are used in such fields, and with these software, not only can you construct the parts, but also assemble them, and observe their functionality.
3D modelling is also used in the field of , wherein products are 3D modeled before representing them to the clients.
In Media and Event industries, 3D modelling is used in .
