"Hello,_World!"_program
A '''"Hello, World!" program''' is a  that outputs "Hello, World!" on a , often . Being a very simple program in most s, it is often used to illustrate the basic  for constructing a working program and getting it to run correctly on a computer.
==Purpose==
A "Hello, world!" program is often used to introduce beginning programmers to a programming language. In general, it is simple enough to be understood easily, especially with the guidance of a teacher or a written guide.
In addition, "Hello world!" can be a useful  to make sure that a language's , , and  are correctly installed. Configuring a complete programming  from scratch to the point where even trivial programs can be compiled and run can involve substantial amounts of work. For this reason, a simple program is used first when testing a new tool chain.
"Hello world!" is also used by computer hackers as a  that arbitrary code can be executed through an  where the system designers did not intend code to be executedfor example, on Sony's . This is the first step in using homemade content ("") on such a device.
==History==
While small test programs existed since the development of programmable s, the tradition of using the phrase "Hello world!" as a test message was influenced by an example program in the seminal book ''''. The example program from that book prints "hello,&nbsp;world" (without capital letters or exclamation mark), and was inherited from a 1974  internal memorandum by , ''Programming in C: A Tutorial'', which contains the first known version:
#include 
main( ) 
The C version was adapted from Kernighan's 1972 ''A Tutorial Introduction to the Language '',
 where the first known version of the program is found in an example used to illustrate external variables:
main()
a 'hell';
b 'o, w';
c 'orld';
The program prints "hello,&nbsp;world!" on the terminal, including a  character. The phrase is divided into multiple variables because in B, a character constant is limited to four  characters. The previous example in the tutorial printed "hi!" on the terminal, so the phrase "hello,&nbsp;world!" was originally introduced as a slightly longer greeting that required several character constants for its expression.
It is also claimed that "hello, world" originated instead with  (1967)., ''''This claim is supported by the archived notes of the inventors of BCPL, Prof. Brian Kernighan at Princeton and Martin Richards at Cambridge.
For modern languages, the hello world program can vary in sophistication. For example, the  introduced a multilingual hello world program, The Go Programming Language. Retrieved July 26, 2011.  demonstrated a  hello world based on , and the  programming language features a spinning Earth hello world using 3D graphics. While some languages such as ,  or  may need only a single statement to print "hello world", a low-level  may require dozens of commands. Mark Guzdial and Elliot Soloway have suggested that the "hello world" test message may be outdated now that graphics and sound can be manipulated as easily as text.
==Variations==
There are many variations on the punctuation and casing of the phrase. Variations include the presence or absence of the comma and exclamation mark, and the capitalization of the 'H', both the 'H' and the 'W', or neither. Some languages are forced to implement different forms, such as "HELLO WORLD!", on systems that support only capital letters, while many "hello world" programs in  print out a slightly modified string. For example, the first non-trivial  program printed "HEllO WORld", this having been determined to be .
There are variations in spirit, as well.  languages, like ,  and , tend to substitute a  program for Hello World, as functional programming emphasizes recursive techniques, whereas the original examples emphasize I/O, which violates the spirit of pure functional programming by producing side effects. Languages otherwise capable of Hello World (Assembly, C, ) may also be used in s, where text output is either difficult (requiring additional components or communication with another computer) or nonexistent. For devices such as s, , and 's, "Hello, World" may thus be substituted with a blinking , which demonstrates timing and interaction between components.
The  and   distributions provide the "hello world" program through the  packaging system; this allows users to simply type "apt-get install hello" for the program to be installed, along with any . While of itself useless, it serves as a  and a simple example to newcomers of how to install a package. It is significantly more useful for developers, however, as it provides an example of how to create a  package, either traditionally or using , and the version of hello used, , serves as an example of how to write a GNU program.
