Amiga_E
'''Amiga E''', or very often simply '''E''', is a  created by Wouter van Oortmerssen on the . He has since moved on to develop the  for the new  and the CryScript language (also known as DOG) used during the development of the  .
Amiga E is a combination of many features from a number of languages, but follows the original  most closely in terms of basic concepts. Amiga E's main benefits are fast compilation (allowing it to be used in place of a scripting language), very readable source code, flexible type system, powerful module system, exception handling (not C++ variant) and .
A  in Amiga E looks like: 
   PROC main()
      WriteF('Hello, World!')
   ENDPROC
Amiga E was used to create the core of the popular Amiga graphics software .

==Implementations==
===''Amiga E'', by Wouter van Oortmerssen.===
The first compiler, written in M68k assembler. Support tools written in E. Generates M68000 machine code directly.
:*Platforms:  and compatibles.
:*Targets: AmigaOS with  CPU.
:*Status: Stable, mature, discontinued, source available, .
===''CreativE'', by Tomasz Wiszkowski.===
Based on the GPL sources of Amiga E and adds many extensions to the compiler.
:*Platforms: AmigaOS and compatibles.
:*Targets: Like Amiga E + some limited support for generating code that takes advantage of later M680x0 CPUs.
:*Status: Stable, mature, discontinued, source available, freeware.
===''PowerD'', by Martin Kuchinka.===
Based on the AmigaE language, but not compatible with it due to changes in syntax.
:*Platforms: AmigaOS and compatibles.
:*Targets: AmigaOS 3.0 68020 CPU+FPU, PPC.
:*Status: Stable, mature, under development, closed source, freeware.
===''YAEC'', by Leif Salomonsson.===
Written from scratch in E. Uses external assembler and linker.
:*Platforms: AmigaOS and compatibles.
:*Targets: AmigaOS 3.0 with 68020 CPU and FPU.
:*Status: Obsolete, unfinished, discontinued, , freeware.
===''ECX'', by Leif Salomonsson.===
A compiler and tools written from scratch in E, can compile itself, supports multiple targets and adds many extensions.
:*Platforms: AmigaOS,  and .
:*Targets: AmigaOS 3.0 68020, AmigaOS 4, MorphOS.
:*Status: Stable, mature, under development, closed source (was open source), shareware (was freeware).
===''PortablE'', by Christopher Handley.===
A meta-compiler written from scratch in E, can compile itself, supports multiple targets.
:*Platforms: ,  (68k),  (PPC),  and .
:*Targets: C++ and Amiga E.
:*Status: Stable, mature, under development, closed source, freeware.
