Arkanoid
is an  developed by  in 1986. It expanded upon 's '''' games of the 1970s by adding s, different types of bricks, and a variety of level layouts. The title refers to a doomed "mothership" from which the player's ship, the Vaus, escapes.
==Overview==
The player controls the "Vaus", a space vessel that acts as the game's "paddle" which prevents a  from falling from the playing field, attempting to bounce it against a number of s. The ball striking a brick causes the brick to disappear. When all the bricks are gone, the player goes to the next level, where another pattern of bricks appears. There are a number of variations (bricks that have to be hit multiple times, flying enemy ships, etc.) and power-up capsules to enhance the Vaus (expand the Vaus, multiply the number of balls, equip a  cannon, break directly to the next level, etc.), but the gameplay remains the same.
At round 33 (36 for the NES version,) the final stage, the player will take on the game's , "DOH", a head resembling .  Once a player reaches round 33, he must defeat DOH with his remaining extra lives because there are no continues on the final round.  In the NES version the final boss is on stage 36, and there are no continues throughout the entire game, so the entire game must be beaten in one sitting.

The controls used by various conversions differ from machine to machine, and some conversions allow for multiple control methods.  The two basic control methods are digital and analog. Digital controls (many joysticks, control pads, etc.) are considered less desirable than analog controls (most mice, trackballs, and paddles); while digital controls limit the player to single-speed control, analog controls allow the player to move the Vaus at nearly any desired speed across the screen.  The NES version of Arkanoid was originally packaged with what is considered one of the rarest of all NES controllers, the : a small gray controller featuring one button, a small spinner (with limited turn angle), an adjustment port, and the Taito logo.  While the game may be played with the standard digital NES control pad, optimum gameplay is achieved with the Vaus Controller.  Latter-day  developers have created customized spinner controls to further simulate the arcade experience, although the Arkanoid controller had quirks which have made it difficult to achieve 100% reproduction. The Japanese DS version features an optional paddle controller that connects in the  slot, but the paddle controller is not being released in America.
