Computer_engineering
'''Computer engineering''' is a  that integrates several fields of  and  required to  develop  and software. Computer engineers usually have training in  (or ), , and hardware-software integration instead of only  or electronic engineering. Computer engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing, from the design of individual s, s, s, and s, to . This field of engineering not only focuses on how computer systems themselves work, but also how they integrate into the larger picture., "Computer engineers need not only to understand how computer systems themselves work, but also how they integrate into the larger picture. Consider the car. A modern car contains many separate computer systems for controlling such things as the engine timing, the brakes and the air bags. To be able to design and implement such a car, the computer engineer needs a broad theoretical understanding of all these various subsystems & how they interact.
Usual tasks involving computer engineers include writing software and  for  s, designing  chips, designing  s, designing mixed signal s, and designing s. Computer engineers are also suited for  research, which relies heavily on using digital systems to control and monitor electrical systems like s, , and s.
In many institutions, computer engineering students are allowed to choose areas of in-depth study in their junior and senior year, because the full breadth of knowledge used in the design and application of computers is beyond the scope of an undergraduate degree. Other institutions may require engineering students to complete one year of General Engineering before declaring computer engineering as their primary focus.
