'''German philosophy''', here taken to mean either (1)  in the  or (2)  by Germans, has been extremely diverse, and central to both the  and  traditions in philosophy for centuries, from  through , , , , ,  and  to contemporary philosophers.  (a  ) is frequently included in surveys of German (or Germanic) philosophy due to his extensive engagement with German thinkers.Lowith, Karl.

==17th century==
===Leibniz===
 (16461716) was both a philosopher and a  who wrote primarily in  and . Leibniz, along with  and , was one of the three great 17th century advocates of . The work of Leibniz also anticipated modern  and , but his philosophy also looks back to the  tradition, in which conclusions are produced by applying reason to first principles or a priori definitions rather than to . 
Leibniz is noted for his optimism - his ''''Rutherford (1998) is a detailed scholarly study of Leibniz's . tries to justify the apparent imperfections of the world by claiming that it is . It must be the best possible and most balanced world, because it was created by an all powerful and all knowing God, who would not choose to create an imperfect world if a better world could be known to him or possible to exist. In effect, apparent flaws that can be identified in this world must exist in every possible world, because otherwise God would have chosen to create the world that excluded those flaws.
Leibniz is also known for his theory of , as exposited in ''''. Monads are to the metaphysical realm what s are to the physical/phenomenal.  They can also be compared to the corpuscles of the  of Ren Descartes and others. Monads are the ultimate elements of the . The monads are "substantial forms of being" with the following properties: they are eternal, indecomposable, individual, subject to their own laws, un-interacting, and each reflecting the entire universe in a  (a historically important example of ). Monads are centers of ; substance is force, while , , and  are merely phenomenal.
==18th century==
===Wolff===
 (16791754) was the most eminent German philosopher between  and . His main achievement was a complete ''oeuvre'' on almost every scholarly subject of his time, displayed and unfolded according to his demonstrative-deductive, mathematical method, which perhaps represents the peak of   in . 
Wolff was one of the first to use  as a language of scholarly instruction and research, although he also wrote in , so that an international audience could, and did, read him.  A founding father of, among other fields,  and  as academic disciplines, he concentrated especially in these fields, giving advice on practical matters to people in , and stressing the professional nature of university education.
===Kant===
In 1781,  (17241804) published his '''', in which he attempted to determine what we can and cannot know through the use of reason independent of all experience. Briefly, he came to the conclusion that we could come to know an external world through experience, but that what we could know about it was limited by the limited terms in which the mind can think: if we can only comprehend things in terms of cause and effect, then we can only know causes and effects. It follows from this that we can know the form of all possible experience independent of all experience, but nothing else, but we can never know the world from the standpoint of nowhere and therefore we can never know the world in its entirety, neither via reason nor experience.
Since the publication of his ''Critique'', Immanuel Kant has been considered one of the greatest influences in all of western philosophy. In the late 18th and early 19th century, one direct line of influence from Kant is .
==19th century==
===German Idealism===
The three most prominent German idealists were  (17621814),  (17751854) and  (17701831), who was the predominant figure in nineteenth century German philosophy.
===Schopenhauer===
An idiosyncratic opponent of German idealism, particularly Hegel's thought, was  (1788&nbsp; 1860). He was influenced by Eastern philosophy, particularly Buddhism, and was known for his . Schopenhauer's most influential work, '''', claimed that the world is fundamentally what we recognize in ourselves as our . His analysis of will led him to the conclusion that emotional, physical, and sexual desires can never be fulfilled. Consequently, he eloquently described a lifestyle of negating  desires, similar to the  teachings of  and the  of .'''', Vol. 2, Ch. 48 (Dover page 616), "The ascetic tendency is certainly unmistakable in , as it was developed in the writings of the  from the kernel of the ; this tendency is the highest point to which everything strives upwards."
===Karl Marx and the Young Hegelians===
Among those influenced by Hegel was a group of young radicals called the , who were unpopular because of their radical views on religion and society. They included  (18041872),  (18091882) and  (18061856) among their ranks.
 (18181883) often attended their meetings. He developed an interest in Hegelianism, French socialism and British economic theory. He transformed the three into an essential work of economics called '''', which consisted of a critical economic examination of capitalism.  became one of the major forces on twentieth century world history.
===Neo-Kantianism===
Neo-Kantianism refers broadly to the revival of the type of philosophy explained by  and of the interpretations of Kant provided by post-Kantian philosophers such as ,  and . Major figures in the neo-Kantian movement, which began around the 1860s, include  and .
===Nietzsche===
 (18441900) was initially a proponent of . However, he soon came to disavow Schopenhauer's pessimistic outlook on life and sought to provide a positive philosophy. He believed this task to be urgent, as he believed a form of nihilism caused by modernity was spreading across Europe, which he summed up in the phrase "God is dead". His problem, then, was how to live a positive life considering that if you believe in God, you give in to dishonesty and cruel beliefs (e.g. divine predestination of some individuals to Hell), and if you don't believe in God, you give in to nihilism. He believed he found his solution in the concepts of the  and . His work continues to have a major influence on both philosophers and artists.
==20th century==
===Analytic philosophy===
====Frege, Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle====
In the late 19th century, the predicate logic of  (18481925) overthrew Aristotelian logic (the dominant logic since its inception in Ancient Greece). This was the beginning of . In the early part of the 20th century, a group of German and Austrian philosophers and scientists formed the  to promote scientific thought over Hegelian system-building, which they saw as a bad influence on intellectual thought. The group considered themselves  because they believed all knowledge is either derived through experience or arrived at through analytic statements, and they adopted the predicate logic of Frege, as well as the early work of  (18891951) as foundations to their work. Wittgenstein did not agree with their interpretation of his philosophy.
===Continental philosophy===
While the seminal philosophers of twentieth-century analytical philosophy were German-speakers, most German-language philosophy of the twentieth century tends to be defined not as analytical but 'continental' philosophy  as befits Germany's position as part of the European 'continent' as opposed to the British Isles or other culturally European nations outside of Europe.
====Phenomenology====
 began at the start of the 20th century with the descriptive psychology of  (18381917), and then the transcendental phenomenology of  (18591938). It was then transformed by  (18891976), whose famous book '''' applied phenomenology to , and who, along with , is considered one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century. Phenomenology has had a large influence on Continental Philosophy, particularly  and . Heidegger himself is often identified as an existentialist, though he would have rejected this.
====Hermeneutics====
Hermeneutics is the philosophical theory and practice of interpretation and understanding.
Originally hermeneutics referred to the interpretation of texts, especially religious texts.http://www.friesian.com/hermenut.htm In the 19th century,  (17681834),  (18331911) and others expanded the discipline of hermeneutics beyond mere  and turned it into a general humanistic discipline.http://www.stonybrook.edu/philosophy/research/ihde_6.html Schleiermacher wondered whether there could be a hermeneutics that was not a collection of pieces of ad hoc advice for the solution of specific problems with text interpretation but rather a "general hermeneutics," which dealt with the "art of understanding" as such, which pertained to the structure and function of understanding wherever it occurs. Later in the 19th century, Dilthey began to see possibilities for continuing Schleiermacher's general hermeneutics project as a "general methodology of the humanities and social sciences".http://www.mac.edu/faculty/richardpalmer/relevance.html
In the 20th century, hermeneutics took an 'ontological turn'. Martin Heidegger's ''Being and Time'' fundamentally transformed the discipline. No longer was it conceived of as being about understanding linguistic communication, or providing a methodological basis for the human sciences - as far as Heidegger was concerned, hermeneutics is ontology, dealing with the most fundamental conditions of man's being in the world.http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hermeneutics/#Turn The Heideggerian conception of hermeneutics was further developed by Heidegger's pupil  (19002002), in his book ''''.
====Frankfurt School====
In 1923,  founded the , drawing from , 's psychoanalysis and  philosophy, which came to be known as the "". Expelled by the , the school reformed again in Frankfurt after . Although they drew from Marxism, they were outspoken opponents of . Books from the group, like  and  '''' and Adornos '''', critiqued what they saw as the failure of the Enlightenment project and the problems of modernity.  consider the Frankfurt school to be one of their precursors.
