Apache_Struts
'''Apache Struts 1''' is a discontinued   for developing  s. It uses and extends the   to encourage developers to adopt a  (MVC) architecture. It was originally created by  and donated to the  in May, 2000. Formerly located under the Apache  and known as '''Jakarta Struts''', it became a top-level Apache project in 2005.
The  framework spun off from Apache Struts aiming to offer enhancements and refinements while retaining the same general architecture of the original Struts framework. However, it was announced in December 2005 that Struts would re-merge with WebWork. WebWork 2.2 has been adopted as '''''', which reached its first full release in February 2007.
== Design goals and overview ==
In a standard  web application, the client will typically call to the server via a . The information is then either handed over to a  which interacts with a database and produces an -formatted response, or it is given to a  (JSP) document that intermingles HTML and Java code to achieve the same result.
Both approaches are often considered inadequate for large projects because they mix application logic with presentation and make maintenance difficult.
The goal of Struts is to separate the ''model'' (application logic that interacts with a database) from the ''view'' (HTML pages presented to the client) and the ''controller'' (instance that passes information between view and model). Struts provides the controller (a servlet known as ActionServlet) and facilitates the writing of templates for the view or presentation layer (typically in JSP, but / and  are also supported). The web application programmer is responsible for writing the model code, and for creating a central configuration file struts-config.xml that binds together model, view, and controller.
Requests from the client are sent to the controller in the form of "Actions" defined in the configuration file; if the controller receives such a request it calls the corresponding Action class that interacts with the application-specific model code. The model code returns an "ActionForward", a string telling the controller what output page to send to the client. Information is passed between model and view in the form of special . A powerful custom tag library allows it from the presentation layer to read and write the content of these beans without the need for any embedded Java code.
Struts is categorized as a  request-based web application framework.
Struts also supports  by web forms, and includes a template mechanism called "Tiles" that (for instance) allows the presentation layer to be composed from independent header, footer, menu navigation and content components.
