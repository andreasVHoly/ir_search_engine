Algorithm_design
'''Algorithm design''' is a specific method to create a mathematical process in solving problems.  Applied algorithm design is .
Algorithm design is identified and incorporated into many solution theories of , such as  and .  Techniques for designing and implementing algorithm designs are algorithm design patterns, such as  and , and uses of data structures, and name and sort lists.  Some current day uses of algorithm design can be found in internet retrieval processes of web crawling, packet routing and caching. 
Mainframe programming languages such as  (for ''Algo''rithmic ''l''anguage), , , PL/I, , and SNOBOL are computing tools to implement an "algorithm design"... but, an "algorithm design" (a/d) is not a language. An a/d can be a hand written process, e.g. set of equations, a series of mechanical processes done by hand, an analog piece of equipment, or a digital process and/or processor.
One of the most important aspects of algorithm design is creating an algorithm that has an efficient runtime, also known as its .
