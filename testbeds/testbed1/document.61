'''20th-century French philosophy''' is a strand of contemporary  generally associated with post- , although it is directly influenced by previous s.
==Bergson==
The work of  (18591941)http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/ is often considered the division point between nineteenth- and twentieth-century French philosophy. Essentially, despite his respect for mathematics and science, he pioneered the French movement of scepticism towards the use of scientific methods to understand human nature and metaphysical reality. , of which, for example, the    was interested in at the time, was not appropriate, he argued. Unlike later philosophers, Bergson was highly influenced by biology, particularly 's '''', which was released the year of Bergson's birth. This led Bergson to discuss the 'Body' and 'Self' in detail, arguably prompting the fundamental ontological and epistemological questions to be raised later in the 20th century. Bergson's work was a major influence on , who wrote a monograph on him ('''') and whose philosophical analyses of cinema ('''' and '''') develop his ideas.

Further, in the entire discussion of ideas which preceded or followed the , it is easy to find the place of those who, from near or from afar, had been trained by Canguilhem.

==Personalism==
