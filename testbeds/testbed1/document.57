'''Sound Blaster X-Fi''' is a lineup of s in 's  series.
==History==
The series was launched in August 2005 as a lineup of  sound cards, served as the introduction for their  audio processing chip, with models ranging from ''XtremeMusic'' (lower end), to ''Platinum'', '' FPS'', and ''Elite Pro'' (top of the range).
