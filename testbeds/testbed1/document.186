==History==
The game was made by teenager  in  for the Apple II while attending high school in the  suburbs. Begun first as a school project during his junior year using the school's mainframe system and Apple II computer, as well as another Apple II bought for him by his father, the game continually evolved over several years under the working title ''D&D'' with the help of his friends and regular ''Dungeons & Dragons'' partners who acted as play-testers. Development of the game began soon after his initial encounter with Apple computers in the summer of 1979,The Official Book of Ultima, by Shay Addams, Second Edition, page 7 but Garriott did not expect that the public would see his work.
When the game reached version ''D&D28b'' later that year (where "28b" refers to the revision), he demoed the game - now renamed to ''Akalabeth'' - for his boss at a -area , who suggested he sell the game in the store. Garriott consented and spent $200 to package and sell the game for $20 inside  bags, with photocopied instructions and a cover drawn by his mother. It warned "BEWARE FOOLISH MORTAL, YOU TRESPASS IN AKALABETH, WORLD OF DOOM!!", and claimed to offer "10 different  Monsters combined with perfect perspective and infinite dungeon levels".  received a copy, and contacted Garriott to publish the game. Garriott flew to California with his parents and agreed to receive $5 for each copy sold. The retail price of the California Pacific version, with cover artwork by , was $35; Garriot claims that the game sold 30,000 copies, with him receiving $150,000, and that ''Akalabeth'' had the best , with later games "all downhill from there". The company suggested that for marketing purposes "" be credited as the author, and organized a contest for ''Softalk'' readers to figure out his true identity.The Official Book of Ultima, by Shay Addams, Second Edition, page 8
In creating ''Akalabeth'', Garriott was primarily inspired by '''', for which he held weekly sessions in his parents' house while in high school; and the works of , which he received from an in-law of his brother. The name derives from Tolkien's '''', part of ''''; though the game is not based on Tolkien's story. In the original game, the last monster on the need-to-kill list is called "Balrog", like the demonic monsters from '''', and unlike the later name for the monster in the Ultima games, Balron.
While not explicitly stated, ''Akalabeth'' is seen as the first game of the '''' series, a very popular and influential series of role-playing video games. It was, therefore, included as part of the 1998 '''Ultima Collection''' where it officially picked up the nickname ''Ultima 0''. The version in the ''Collection'' added  colors and . It ran on , making it the first official port of the game to any system other than the Apple II, though an unofficial, fan-made PC version had circulated on the  since late 1995.
Copies of the original ''Akalabeth'' are much more rare than those of other games that sold fewer than 30,000 copies. Historian Jimmy Maher believes that Garriott is mistaken on the figure, as the game only appeared near the bottom of the ''''s monthly list of the top 30 best-selling Apple II programs twice before being discontinued in 1982; by contrast s '''', which often appeared near the top of the list, sold 25,000 copies by mid-1982. Given California Pacific's high royalty rates he suggests that 10,000 copies might have been enough for Garriott to earn $150,000.
==Gameplay and technology==
Garriott is the sole author of the game, with the exception of title artwork by Keith Zabalaoui. The game attempts to bring the  of s to the computer platform. The player receives quests from Lord British (Garriott's alter-ego and nickname since high school) to kill a succession of ten increasingly difficult s.
The majority of gameplay takes place in an underground dungeon, but there were also a simple above-ground world map and text descriptions to fill out the rest of the adventure. The player could visit the Adventure Shop to purchase food, weapons, a shield and a magic amulet; the player's statistics can also be viewed here.
The game used concepts that would later become standard in the Ultima series, including:
* First-person gameplay in dungeons
* Requiring food to survive
* A top-down overhead world view
*  used for commands
* The use of  English
Garriott's earlier versions before ''D&D28b'' used an overhead view with ASCII characters representing items and monsters. However, after playing ''Escape'', an early maze game for the Apple II, he instead decided to switch to a , first-person view for the underground dungeon portions of the game, the first computer role-playing game with such graphics. The game asks the player to provide a "lucky number", which it uses as a  to  the rest of the game, including dungeons and player stats; by using the same number the player can always return to a given world. (The ''Ultima Collection'' version removed this feature and only uses one dungeon design, while adding .)
While crude by modern standards, in 1980 ''Akalabeth'''s graphics and  gameplay mechanics were considered quite advanced, and the game attracted a large amount of attention. And, since ''Akalabeth'' was written in , an , it was a simple matter for users to modify the  to suit their needs or desires. For example, the game's magic amulet, which occasionally did unpredictable things like turn a player into a high-powered Lizard Man, or a weak Toad, could be set for "Lizard Man" with every use, progressively increasing the player's strength to the point of virtual indestructibility. One could also set the player's statistics (normally randomly generated and fairly weak to start) to any level desired. Also later  offered the source code on their s. on hardcoregaming101.net ''"Origin Systems for a time had the original Apple II source code of Akalabeth for download on their website's FTP server"'' on uo.com (archived)
==Release date==
Most sources, including Garriott and , say that ''Akalabeth'' was created in the summer of 1979 after he graduated from high school, and sold that year in Ziploc bags. Maher believes that Garriott did not begin selling ''Akalabeth'' until the summer of 1980, after his first year of college. California Pacific widely released the game in 1980 with a 1980 copyright date, and ''Akalabeth'' first appeared on the ''Softalk'' top 30 list for the month of October 1980. See Garriott's post and Maher's response in the comments.
==Reception==
The game was reviewed in 1982 in '''' #65 by Bruce Humphrey. Humphrey concluded that "Akalabeth is a poor cousin in relation to '''' and some of the other recent role-playing computer games." Scorpia of '''', a fan of ''Ultima'', agreed in 1991 and 1993: "Bluntly, it wasn't all that terrific". She did, however, note that the game was the first to offer 3-D perspective dungeon graphics. Historian Jimmy Maher in 2011 wrote that he was surprised by how much more "playable" the game was than ''''. Despite lacking basic functionality like the ability to save progress, Maher stated that ''Akalabeth'' had "a remarkably forward-thinking, even player-friendly design for its era".
